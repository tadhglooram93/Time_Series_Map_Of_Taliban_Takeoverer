Extended Troika Members Support Review of UN Sanctions on Taliban
","
Representatives of the extended “Troika,” comprising the United States, Russia, China, and Pakistan, met in Doha on Friday to discuss ways to support intra-Afghan negotiations and help the parties reach a negotiated settlement and a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire. 
The extended “Troika” met with representatives of the Islamic Republic negotiating team and of the Taliban, as well as Qatar, who graciously hosted the participants, according to a statement by the US Department of State.
The statement says that the extended “troika” members “support a review of the status of designations of Taliban individuals and entities on the UN 1988 sanctions, as stated in the UNSC resolution 2513 (2020).” Practical measures to reduce violence and sustained efforts to advance intra-Afghan negotiations by the Taliban will positively affect this review process, the statement added.
“We acknowledge the widespread and sincere demand of the Afghan people for a lasting and just peace and an end to the war,” the statement said. “We reiterate that there is no military solution in Afghanistan and a negotiated political settlement through an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned process is the only way forward for lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan.”
The statement said that the extended troika members take note of the April 14 announcement by the United States and NATO that US/NATO forces will begin a responsible withdrawal from Afghanistan by May 1, 2021 that concludes by September 11, 2021. 
“We reiterate that the withdrawal of foreign troops should ensure a steady transition of the situation in Afghanistan. We stress that, during the withdrawal period, the peace process should not be disrupted, no fights or turbulence shall occur in Afghanistan, and the safety of international troops should be ensured,” the statement said.
The statement said that “we expect the Taliban to fulfill its counterterrorism commitments, including preventing terrorist groups and individuals from using Afghan soil to threaten the security of any other country; not hosting these groups and preventing them from recruiting, training, and fundraising.” 
“We expect the Afghan government to continue counterterrorism cooperation with the international community,” the statement said.
The participants reiterated their call on all parties to the conflict in Afghanistan to reduce the level of violence in the country and on the Taliban not to pursue a Spring offensive. 
“We condemn in the strongest terms any attacks deliberately targeting civilians in Afghanistan and call on all parties to respect their obligations under international humanitarian law in all circumstances, including those related to protection of civilians,” the statement said.
The statement calls on all Afghans including the Government of the Islamic Republic and the Taliban to ensure that terrorist groups and individuals do not use Afghan soil to threaten the security of any other country.
“We reaffirm that any peace agreement must include protections for the rights of all Afghans, including women, men, children, victims of war, and minorities, and should respond to the strong desire of all Afghans for economic, social and political development including the rule of law,” the statement concluded.

Logar Bombing Condemned as ‘Crime against Humanity’

The deadly truck bomb attack that targeted a guest house in Logar province on Friday evening was widely condemned as a crime against humanity and a terrorist attack against the people of Afghanistan.
The Presidential Palace said the “terrorist attack” targeted “innocent people” including students who were seeking to attend university entrance exams in the province.
Calling it a crime against humanity, the Afghan government blamed the Taliban for the bombing. The group has not commented on the attack so far.
Abdullah Abdullah, head of the High Council for National Reconciliation, also condemned the blast and called it “a cowardly terrorist attack against Afghan civilians.”
Former president Hamid Karzai in a statement condemned the attack as cowardly and an act by Afghanistan’s enemies. 
He asked parties to the conflict to expedite their efforts for peace.
The French embassy in Kabul in a statement said they condemn in the strongest terms those who deliberately targeted civilians in yesterday’s Logar car bomb attack. 
“Such senseless terrorist violence must come to an end, the people of #Afghanistan deserve peace,” the embassy said.
Turkey’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a statement said, “We condemn the perpetrators of this heinous terrorist attack and hope that they will be held accountable before justice.”

Foreign Forces Have Started Withdrawal: Gen. Zia
","
The acting minister of defense, Gen. Yasin Zia, at a press briefing on Saturday said that the US and NATO forces have started their withdrawal from the country – as the May 1 deadline agreed in Doha deal has approached.
“The withdrawal of foreign forces has practically started,” he said. “They will hand over the areas where their logistics issues have been addressed will be handed (to Afghan forces) by the end of this week,” Zia said.
He said that the US and NATO forces will first leave other bases and will be transferred to Bagram and from there they will leave abroad.
Zia said that the last batch of foreign forces will leave Camp Shorab in Helmand on Sunday.
The withdrawal of foreign forces has been accompanied by concerns among Afghans about the future of the country.
Addressing the same press conference, National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib said that their calculations show that the Taliban will continue their violence and that going forward, “every Afghan will be a target” for them.
United States has around 2,500 troops in Afghanistan and based on the Biden administration's decision, their number will be zero by Sept. 11.

Govt Sees No Reason for Taliban Violence as Foreign Troops Leave
","
Afghan National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib on Saturday questioned ongoing violence by the Taliban, saying the government does not see any justification for a the violence at a time that the US and NATO forces have started withdrawing from Afghanistan.
“The Taliban is a force that is only seeking power,"" Mohib said. ""They use different tactics to justify the violence. If they justify the killing of the civilians, they even justify the slavey of an intelligence agency.”
Mohib states that the Taliban gets all their military equipment and explosive materials from the Pakistan’s intelligence agency, the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI).
“The Taliban are slaves of the ISI. They get all their equipment and explosions for killing of Afghans and destruction of Afghanistan from there (Pakistan) and the entire world knows about it and the Taliban needs to explain it,” Mohib said.
Mohib said that al Qaeda is playing a key role in keeping the Taliban’s war machine active in Afghanistan. 
Taliban has often rejected the allegations that it still maintains close ties with al Qaeda.
“The Taliban claims that no other group can conduct the (war), except them, the Taliban also claim that when they give order, the violence stops and no one is there to launch attack. In this scenario, all responsibilities go to the Taliban,"" he said. ""But there are also other groups that conduct such activities. You saw the statement of Al Qaeda. Daesh is also operating there, but all these are carrying out their activities in harmony with the Taliban.""
Meanwhile, members of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) have reiterated their determination to defend the nation and the country’s borders against any hostile move.
This comes as lawmakers from Ghazni province in the parliament have said that at least 30 security force members gone missing after the Taliban took over their outpost in Arezo village in the city of Ghazni.
 Security officials however said that the case is not that much serious and only 17 security force members had been under the siege.
“There was a small outpost in the Arezo village. It was not a base. The outpost has fallen. We are investigating the incident to find out the main reasons. Other forces have been deployed and there is no any major issue there. There were around 17 people from the three security agencies,” Acting Defense Minister Gen. Yasin Zia said.
This comes weeks after US President Joe Biden announced his intention to withdraw all US troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, 2021.

Most of the victims were the students who had gathered there in Pul-e-Alam for university entrance exam.
They were from Azra district of Logar.
“I was in a tailoring shop. It was near the dusk and we were preparing for Iftar dinner when the tragedy happened,” said Allah Noor, a survivor.

Afghan Leaders Must Be United in Peace Talks: Abdullah
","
Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, said Saturday the often fractured Afghan political leadership must unify in its peace talks with the Taliban or risk more bitter fighting as the US and NATO withdraws, AP reported.
Abdullah said the time is now for Afghanistan’s political leaders to stand united in the talks.
In an interview with AP in Kabul, Abdullah warned that history and millions of Afghans — already frustrated by what they see as government ineptitude and runaway corruption — will judge them harshly if unity eludes the powerful leaders now in Kabul.
In the early 1990s bitter fighting between many of the same leaders killed thousands of mostly civilians in the capital and gave rise to the Taliban, who took power in 1996, the report said.
Abdullah said the withdrawal that officially began Saturday of the remaining 2,500 to 3,500 US troops and about 7,000 NATO allied forces will present “huge challenges.”
“I wouldn’t call it the end of the world for our people. I would say that it will be very challenging and that’s why I am of the opinion that the whole focus has to be on achieving peace, that does not only take us, it takes the other side,” he said.
Still, Abdullah said he is unconvinced the Taliban want peace. He said the National Reconciliation Council, of which he is the chairman, has put out countless calls for the Taliban to put all their demands on the table.
Messages go back and forth between a variety of Taliban to senior negotiators, including himself, said Abdullah. He noted that he has received countless messages from Taliban officials, some written, some as voice messages. Sometimes they are detailed, and other times terse and brief. But he said he has yet to see a commitment to peace from the insurgent group on which he can rely.
Abdullah said his response to the Taliban has been consistent: “Put everything that you want on the negotiating table. We are ready to discuss it. We are ready to find ways that it works for both sides.”
He said the withdrawal adds pressure on both sides to find a peace deal.
On Saturday, the Afghan National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib condemned the ongoing violence by the Taliban, saying the government does not see any justification for the violence as the US and NATO forces have begun withdrawing from Afghanistan.
“The Taliban is a force that is only seeking power,"" Mohib said. ""They use different tactics to justify the violence. If they justify the killing of the civilians, they even justify being slaves of an intelligence agency.”

Al-Qaeda Not Completely Uprooted in Afghanistan: Officials
","
Today marks the 10th anniversary of the killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden by American special forces in 2011 in Pakistan, but the Afghan government says that the roots of the network are still alive in Afghanistan and the group still poses a threat to the country and the world and is collaborating with the Taliban.
But the Taliban has rejected any type of relations with al-Qaeda.
The US presence in Afghanistan over the last 20 years was due to the existence of al-Qaeda. US President Joe Biden last month said the US has achieved its objectives in the Afghanistan war.
“Right now, al-Qaeda and Talib are not two different ideologic topics; they are beyond that as they have intermarried within their families,” NDS chief Ahmad Zia Saraj said last week.
The question that arises is how can al-Qaeda pose a threat to Afghanistan and the world while its leader was killed ten years back?
“Al-Qaeda was not owned by bin Laden,” said Atiqullah Amarkhil, a former military officer. “Al-Qaeda is still active in Afghanistan and anyone who says that we have eliminated al-Qaeda--they are lying.”
The Afghan government sees the Taliban’s ties with al-Qaeda as a key challenge in the way of the peace process.
“Even though the Taliban has agreed with the US to cut ties with al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups, al-Qaeda is still fighting among the Taliban,” said Rahmatullah Andar, spokesman for National Security Council.
Meanwhile, Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, said Saturday the often-fractured Afghan political leadership must unify in its peace talks with the Taliban or risk more bitter fighting as the US and NATO withdraws, AP reported.

Senators Seek Thorough Probe Into Kabul Fire That Killed 9 People
","
Senators on Sunday raised questions over recent fires in Kabul, Farah and Herat province that mainly targeted fuel imports, saying there are ""some hands behind such incidents"" that seek to harm the country’s economy.
The Ministry of Interior Affairs said that nine people were killed and 14 more were wounded in the major fire at a tanker truck station in the Qala-e-Murad Bek area north of Kabul along the key highway that connects the capital city with northern provinces.
At least 60 vehicles, including fuel tanker trucks as well as trucks carrying food and other goods, were completely damaged in the fire that started around 9:00 pm on Saturday.
The Chamber of Trade and Investment said an investigation into the incident has begun, but added that the use of a magnetic bomb is one of the possible reasons for the massive fire.
The chamber estimates the losses of the fire at around $20 million.
The Kabul fire was the fourth in less than three months, following a major fire at Herat customs office and two more at a border town in Farah that shares a border with Iran.
“Such incidents need a thorough probe to determine whether it was an enemy action,” said Mohammad Khan, a senator.
Senators said that one of the reasons can be a lack of attention by government officials in the proper management of the country’s border towns, ports and customs.
“A fire happened at Kabul gate. All these incidents must be probed thoroughly,” Senate Speaker Fazl Hadi Muslimyar said.
Following the major fire at the border town of Islam Qala in mid-February, the government vowed to make public its findings on the incident, particularly on how it happened. But senators said the report has not been made public so far.
“There is no one responsible. The culture of impunity has expanded more than in the past,” Deputy Senate Speaker Mohammad Alam Ezedyar said.
Eyewitnesses said the fire spread rapidly after it broke out as the fuel tankers were parked very close to each other.
“They exploded one after another in five seconds,” said Ghulam Nabi, a fuel truck owner who says his vehicle was burned in the fire.
Other tanker truck owners said they are fed up with the government checkpoints along their way to Kabul as they are stopped for several hours each time they reach the entrance gates of the capital city.
“We were allowed to move at 12:30 pm but we were stopped by the checkpoint. We are devastated,” said Najibullah, a truck owner.
“I was asked to give 300 Afs to move. Is it the government?” asked Ghulam Sakhi, owner of a fuel tanker.
Kabul governor Yaqub Haidari said that those who have stopped the vehicles and have made the parking where the fuel tankers were parked should be responsible.
“On what decision was this parking made?” he asked.

But the Defense Ministry said that the Taliban’s casualties were more than 100 in the last 24 hours. The Taliban rejected this figure. 
 
Data collected by TOLOnews shows that 438 members of Afghan forces and civilians were killed and more than 500 others were wounded in the last 30 days. The data shows that 190 bombings, targeted attacks and offensives happened in the last month. 
 
A reliable source meanwhile reported a Taliban attack on an outpost on the outskirts of Pul-e-Khumri city in Baghlan province. Sources said that three members of the police special unit were killed in the attack. 
 
Meanwhile, eight members of the public uprising forces were killed in a Taliban attack in Warduj district of Badakhshan province, three policemen were killed in Taliban attack in Zabul, two people were killed in a targeted attack in Kandahar, one person was killed in Gardez and one person was killed in an attack by unidentified armed men in Farah over the last 24 hours. 
 
“Attacks have been intensified in Uruzgan over the last few days. There are clashes every day,” said Amanullah Hotaki, head of the Uruzgan provincial council. 
 
“We witness blasts in Kunar every day. The government should prevent such attacks,” said Nasir Kamawal, a member of the Kunar provincial council. 
 
Some security officials said that May 1st witnessed an increase in Taliban attacks in parts of the country. 
 
“Over the last 24 hours, attacks were carried out in Panjwai, Arghistan, Maiwand, Shah Wali Kot, Nesh, Mianshin and Takhta Pul districts and other outposts,” said Jamal Barikzai, spokesman for the Kandahar police. 
The government forces said that all Taliban attacks were pushed back and they suffered heavy casualties. 
 
This comes as a US forces spokesman Col. Sonny Leggett on Saturday said that Kandahar Airfield received ineffective indirect fire on Saturday afternoon. No injury to personnel or damage to equipment, he said. 
Referring to this attack, US and NATO forces commander in Afghanistan Gen. Scott Miller said: “A return to violence would be one senseless and tragic. But make no mistake, we have the military means to respond forcefully to any type of attacks against the coalition and the military means to support the Afghan security forces. That would be a mistake to move in that direction.” 
 
“Security forces are in a better position,” said Fawad Aman, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense. “The Taliban is faced with defeat on the battlefield and all their focus is on harming civilians.” 
 
The US forces started their withdrawal from Afghanistan on May 1st. 
 
The Defense Ministry said that Camp Antonik in the Washir district in the southern province of Helmand was officially handed over to the ANA’s 215 Maiwand Corp on Sunday.  
 
The ministry said the camp will be used as a base for Afghan special forces.

Home, Vehicle Owners Protest Over Kabul Fire Damages
","
A massive fire that began with a tanker truck carrying fuel in the Shakar Dara district of Kabul along the highway connecting the capital with northern provinces has inflicted heavy damage to vehicles and nearby houses as residents described. 
This led to a protest by residents of the area who closed the highway to traffic for many hours on Sunday. 
The fire first erupted in a tanker truck that was parked among dozens of others in a line waiting to enter Kabul. 
Owners of the fuel tanker trucks said they are often stopped like this by security forces and officials before they enter Kabul. They said it has been one of their main concerns for a long time. 
Mohammad Mokhtar, a resident of the Qala-e-Murad Bek district in Shakardara where the fire broke out, said he built his house after years of extreme effort, but everything was burned by last night’s fire. 
 
“Which law allows tanker trucks containing gas and fuel to park near people’s houses? If we don’t know as members of the public, the government knows it,” Mokhtar said. 
 
Unconfirmed figures by the residents show that at least 100 houses were damaged in the Qala-e-Murad Bek area. A restaurant, a fuel station, many shops and many vehicles that were passing through have been damaged in the fire. 
 
Unconfirmed figures show that dozens of tanker trucks were burned in the fire. 
 
“We suggested many times to transfer the checkpoint from here, but no one heard our voice, including in the Shakardara district governor’s office,” said Jamshid, a resident of Qala-e-Murad Bek. 
 
“We ask the government to look after these people. Now all have lost many things,” said a resident of Qala-e-Murad Bek, a village north of the city of Kabul. 
 
Other residents said that the government has failed to build a parking slot for the fuel tankers to ensure their safety. Now trucks park in a line near the entrance gate of Kabul. 
 
“This is not a proper place because there are many residential houses around. The (Kabul) governor issued orders many times, but they were not implemented,” Shakardara district governor Gawhar Khan Baburi said. 
 
Trucks carrying goods also park near the entrance gate leading into Kabul.

Of the country’s highways, the Kabul-Kandahar Highway is considered as the deadliest in terms of the accidents that happen.
Officials said carelessness by drivers--and their exhaustion--are main reasons that create deadly traffic accidents.
Last year, according to the figures, 3,220 traffic accidents happened last solar year (March 2020 to March 2021) in which 276 people were killed and 1,795 more were wounded.

Biden Says US Will Disrupt Any Threat from Afghanistan
","
US President Joe Biden in a statement on 10th anniversary of raid that killed Osama bin Laden said that the United States will remain vigilant about the threat from terrorist groups that have metastasized around the world.
“As we bring to an end America’s longest war and draw down the last of our troops from Afghanistan, al Qaeda is greatly degraded there,"" Biden said. “But the United States will remain vigilant about the threat from terrorist groups that have metastasized around the world. We will continue to monitor and disrupt any threat to us that emerges from Afghanistan.”
He said that ten years ago, he joined President Obama and members of US national security team to ""watch as our military delivered long-awaited justice to Osama bin Laden.”
“It is a moment I will never forget—the intelligence professionals who had painstakingly tracked him down; the clarity and conviction of President Obama in making the call; the courage and skill of our team on the ground,” he said.
“It had been almost ten years since our nation was attacked on 9/11 and we went to war in Afghanistan, pursuing al Qaeda and its leaders. We followed bin Laden to the gates of hell—and we got him. We kept the promise to all those who lost loved ones on 9/11: that we would never forget those we had lost, and that the United States will never waver in our commitment to prevent another attack on our homeland and to keep the American people safe,” he added.
Al-Qaeda not 'completely' uprooted in Afghanistan
The Afghan government says that the roots of the network are still alive in Afghanistan and the group still poses a threat to the country and the world and is collaborating with the Taliban.
But the Taliban has rejected any type of relations with al-Qaeda.
The US presence in Afghanistan over the last 20 years was due to the existence of al-Qaeda. Biden last month said the US has achieved its objectives in the Afghanistan war.
“Right now, al-Qaeda and Talib are not two different ideologic topics; they are beyond that as they have intermarried within their families,” NDS chief Ahmad Zia Saraj said last week.
The question that arises is how can al-Qaeda pose a threat to Afghanistan and the world while its leader was killed ten years back?
“Al-Qaeda was not owned by bin Laden,” said Atiqullah Amarkhil, a former military officer. “Al-Qaeda is still active in Afghanistan and anyone who says that we have eliminated al-Qaeda--they are lying.”
The Afghan government sees the Taliban’s ties with al-Qaeda as a key challenge in the way of the peace process.
“Even though the Taliban has agreed with the US to cut ties with al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups, al-Qaeda is still fighting among the Taliban,” said Rahmatullah Andar, spokesman for National Security Council.
Meanwhile, Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, said Saturday the often-fractured Afghan political leadership must unify in its peace talks with the Taliban or risk more bitter fighting as the US and NATO withdraws, AP reported.

Afghan Forces 'Reasonably' Well Equipped, Trained: Milley
","
General Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, in an interview with Associated Press and CNN reporters on Sunday described the Afghan military and police as ""reasonably well equipped, reasonably well trained, reasonably well led.""  
He cited Afghan troops' years of experience against a resilient insurgency, but he declined to say they are fully ready to stand up to the Taliban without direct international backing during a potential Taliban offensive, AP noted.
He said that the Afghan forces face an uncertain future and, in a worst-case scenario, some ""bad possible outcomes"" against Taliban insurgents as the withdrawal of foreign troops form Afghanistan accelerates in the coming weeks. 
Asked whether he believes the Afghan forces can hold up under increased strain, Milley was noncommittal. 
""Your question: The Afghan army, do they stay together and remain a cohesive fighting force or do they fall apart? I think there's a range of scenarios here, a range of outcomes, a range of possibilities,"" he said. ""On the one hand you get some really dramatic, bad possible outcomes. On the other hand, you get a military that stays together and a government that stays together."" 
""Which one of these options obtains and becomes reality at the end of the day? We frankly don't know yet. We have to wait and see how things develop over the summer."" 
He said there is ""at least still the possibility"" of a negotiated political settlement between the government in Kabul and the Taliban. This, he said, would avoid the ""massive civil war"" that some fear could happen. 
Milley mentioned that the Afghan forces have operated in recent years with less reliance on US and coalition advisers.  
""But, for the most part, there's no advisers out there anyway,"" he said. 
In the meantime, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in an interview with CBS on Afghanistan said: “We have to be prepared for every scenario, and there-- there are a range of them. And-- we-- we-- we're looking at this-- in a very clear-eyed way.” 
“We've been engaged in Afghanistan for 20 years, and we sometimes forget why we went there in the first place, and that was to deal with the people who attacked us on 9/11. And we did. Just because our troops are coming home doesn't mean we're leaving,”Blinken said. “We're not. Our embassy's staying, the support that we're giving to Afghanistan when it comes to-- economic support, development, humanitarian, that-- that remains. And not only from us, from partners and allies,” he said. 
Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, when asked if the US withdrawal would cause an increase in violence, said: “There is always a possibility of that. Should [the] Taliban choose to increase violence with the hope that they can take advantage of that situation. That’s a possibility and I hope that they are not [don’t] making that mistake.” 
“Natural circumstances when these sorts of situations take place and when one side thinks that because of the vacuum that the withdrawal leaves, it may be able to take advantage of that situation, that emboldens the position of the sides,” Abdullah said. 
“The one which is more on the military term rather than peaceful means. And that’s the concern, that the Taliban position might get further emboldened,” he said. “Well, as far as their excuses, or the reasons that they were giving, that it is because of the presence of the international forces, it’s ‘jihad’ against foreigners and so on and so forth, so, in three months time, perhaps in less than three months time, there will be no foreign troops on our [Afghanistan’s] soil.” 
He also said that “we cannot rule out that scenario, that the situation will get very difficult for the people and the war will continue. At this stage the Taliban have not said that they are not talking. Let’s not lose hope because it will be a worst-case scenario. So, at this stage, the whole focus should be on how to make it work [happen].” 
On Saturday, the US and its NATO allies officially began withdrawing their remaining forces and equipment from Afghanistan.

Taliban, US in Talks Over Full Withdrawal by July: Sources
","
Americans and the Taliban are discussing the possibility of ending the withdrawal process by the beginning of July, sources familiar with the matter said.  
The Taliban will return to the talks, will attend the Turkey conference and will reduce violence if there is an agreement on the matter, the sources said. 
The US began its withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan this week, and, based on President Joe Biden’s decision, the process was to be completed by Sept. 11. According to the Doha agreement, the US was expected to complete the withdrawal by May 1.  
The Taliban considers the postponement of the withdrawal date a violation of the Doha agreement.
“The US has set a deadline for itself and it is possible that the Taliban will not agree to it and then a deadline in the middle will be agreed upon,” said former Taliban commander Sayed Akbar Agha. 
US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad arrived in Kabul on Monday and, according to sources, he intends to discuss his regional trip and the upcoming Istanbul conference with Afghan officials, along with other topics related to the peace process. 
Khalilzad met with Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum in Uzbekistan this week. He also met with Uzbekistan Foreign Minister Abdulaziz Kamilov and discussed the Afghan peace process. 
“Discussions were held on the peace process and the Istanbul conference as well as political consensus,” Dostum’s spokesman Ehsan Nairo said. 
However, Second Vice President Sarwar Danesh at an event on Monday called the Taliban a rebellious and fugitive group that is thirsty for power. 
“The Taliban, because it has turned away from peace, is considered a fugitive group because, based on a verse of the Holy Quran, if a group violates the call for peace, it is considered violent and fugitive,” Danesh said. 
 
Khalilzad also met with peace negotiators in Doha during his trip to Qatar last week. 
 
“Efforts to hold the upcoming Turkey conference were welcomed. And the US envoy assured his country’s continued support to the government and the people of Afghanistan,” said Ghulam Farooq Majroh, a republic negotiator. 
 
The Istanbul conference was delayed two times because the Taliban backed out. It is expected to be held late this month.

MPs Blame Taliban for Rise in Violence as US Exit Begins
","
Lawmakers in the Wolesi Jirga, the lower house of Parliament, blamed the Taliban for the increase in violence and said that hundreds of civilians and security force members are killed in clashes every day as US troops are leaving.  
 
The lawmakers expected heads of security agencies to appear on Monday session, but the officials had traveled to Ghazni and the session was postponed for Wednesday. 
 
The US started the withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan on May 1st. On Sunday, US forces handed over a military camp to Afghan forces in Helmand province.  
 
“Ghazni will fall if it does not receive equipment as well as support from the people,” said Arif Rahmani, an MP from Ghazni. 
 
“Heavy fighting is underway on the outskirts of Lashkargah,” said Nasima Niazi, an MP from Helmand. 
 
“All borders of Nuristan province are open to armed opponents,” said Qamar Banu, an MP from Nuristan. 
 
Meanwhile, the international relations committee of the Parliament in a statement called the US withdrawal irresponsible and said the only way to remove the Taliban and the threat of other terrorist groups is national unity. 
 
“An irresponsible withdrawal, and the failure to create an alternative security mechanism, will do irreversible damage to international security,” said Qayum Sajjadi, a member of the commission. 
 
“As foreigners leave the country, they do pro-Taliban propaganda every day,” said Iqbal Safi, an MP from Kapisa. 
 
Other lawmakers meanwhile insisted on the need for unity--among the people and between politicians--and called for a consensus among regional and international countries to overcome the current situation. 
 
“The defense and security forces are the only true sons and defenders of this soil who are bravely defending national sovereignty against any type of plot,” Parliament Speaker Mir Rahman Rahmani said. 
 
“Let’s unite and announce a national jihad against the Talib,” said Abdul Sattar Husaini, an MP from Farah. 
 
The MPs said the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces need to be supported by Afghans as they are paying the ultimate sacrifice in the war every day.

Sources from Farah said that at least 20 members of the Afghan National Army were killed in a Taliban attack on an outpost in Bala Boluk district in Farah on Sunday night.
“It was not a base, it was an outpost for the safety of the base… The situation in other parts of Farah is under control,” said Taj Mohammad Jahid, the governor of Farah.
“The outpost has been destroyed,” said Dadullah Qani, head of the provincial council in Farah. 
A hand grenade exploded near a school for girls in the city of Farah on Monday, injuring 20 civilians and a soldier, according to local sources
Meanwhile, Badakhshan, Herat, Kabul, Logar, Nangarhar, Baghlan and Helmand provinces also witnessed security incidents and Taliban attacks in the last 24 hours. In these provinces, at least 19 civilians and security forces were killed and 22 more were wounded. 
“The attacks will increase but they will not achieve anything because they will increase people’s hate toward Taliban activities,” said former Afghan intelligence chief Rahmatullah Nabil. 
Ataullah Afghan, head of Helmand's provincial council, said the province has witnessed heavy clashes between security forces and the Taliban in the last two days, in which eight soldiers have died and 20 more have been wounded.  
Afghan said that at least 10 outposts in Helmand have fallen to the Taliban over the last two days, and he reiterated that the province requires the government's full attention.

The Ministry of Defense in a statement said that 62 Taliban were killed and 58 more were wounded by Afghan forces defending positions in Laghman, Ghazni, Balkh, Herat, Faryab, Farah and Badakhshan provinces in the last 24 hours.
The ministry in a separate statement said that 11 militants, including 9 Taliban members and 2 al Qaeda members, were killed in Nahr-e-Siraj district in Helmand province on Sunday.
“The Taliban, by increasing violence, provides the grounds for more casualties for its members because the Afghan Defense and Security Forces are much more ready, firm and serious against the terrorist group,” Defense Ministry spokesman Rohullah Ahmadzai said. 
“We hope that the government makes better plans against the enemy so that we see an end to the bloodshed,” said Amir Mohammad Khaksar, an MP from Takhar.
The increased violence coincides with US forces having started their withdrawal from the country on May 1. So far, the US has handed over one camp to Afghan forces in Helmand province.

In Wake of Logar Attack, Ghani Says Afghan Education Under Threat

President Ashraf Ghani at an event on Tuesday said that Afghanistan’s education system is now in jeopardy as the country’s enemies are targeting students and destroying infrastructure.
He indirectly referred to the recent car bomb attack in Logar province that killed at least 26 people, most of whom were students.
He inaugurated buildings for 59 schools in 22 provinces during the event and said the education sector is the key to development in the country.
“Today, our education is faced with a cruel attack. Today our student, who should be planning his future with a calm mind, is assassinated,” Ghani said.
First Vice President Amrullah Saleh said that the country’s schools are accommodating students three times beyond capacity.
“Today, in our schools, there are three times more girls and boys than their capacity,” said Saleh, who expressed hopes that the quest for education among Afghan children and youth will continue.
The acting minister of education, Rangina Hamidi, said that her ministry has facilitated education with minimal facilities.
“Education is the backbone for Afghanistan, and I assure you that we will be able to have a brighter future for Afghanistan if this sector improves,” Hamidi said.
This comes amid complaints about a lack of school buildings and schoolteachers in some provinces, including Kabul.
The Ministry of Education on April 10 said there is a need for at least 50,000 new teachers for the country’s schools, as the current number of instructors is not sufficient.
Afghanistan’s schools have at least 220,000 teachers for 9.7 million students across the country.
Along with the lack of school buildings, textbooks and other educational resources, the lack of teachers is said to be one of the major challenges facing the education sector in the country.

US: Strong Intl Consensus Against a Taliban Military Takeover
","
The US Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad has said that a Taliban plan to seize control of Afghanistan with a military takeover would not be acceptable to the world. 
According to a statement from the US embassy, Khalilzad ""emphasized that there was strong consensus within both the regional and international community against any effort by the Taliban to pursue a military takeover. Only a negotiated settlement can end over 40 years of war in Afghanistan and Ambassador Khalilzad pledged common cause with Afghan leaders to accelerate efforts to reach an inclusive settlement and permanent and comprehensive ceasefire.”
In separate meetings with Afghan political leaders in Kabul, Khalilzad called for a political consensus to be formed among Afghan political leaders to help pave the way for successful peace negotiation talks with the Taliban.
Meanwhile, President Ashraf Ghani has said that with the completion of the withdrawal of foreign forces, all decisions regarding the country will be taken by the Afghan people and the government. He again called on the Taliban to surrender to peace.
He said that the Afghan government is ready for all scenarios if provoked.
“Now that the foreign forces are leaving, all national decisions will be taken by the Afghan people and the government,” said Ghani, amid rumors about the release of the remaining Taliban prisoners from the Afghan government jails.
Meanwhile, a member of the High Council of National Reconciliation (HCNR) who met Khalilzad in Kabul said that in the meeting discussions were held about the success of the upcoming UN-led summit on Afghanistan in Turkey.
“He (Khalilzad) stressed the importance of the existence of the system, the protection of the security forces and the army,” said Haji Din Mohammad, a member of the HCNR.
“If the consensus is limited to the meeting of a few political leaders, this can’t be evaluated as a solution,” said political analyst Wais Naseri.
Meanwhile, President Ashraf Ghani in an article in Foreign Affairs said that the Afghan government respects the decision of US President of Joe Biden about withdrawing troops from Afghanistan and views it as a moment of both opportunity and risk for itself, for Afghans, for the Taliban, and for the region.
“For me, as the elected leader of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, it is another opportunity to reiterate and further my commitment to peace,” wrote Ghani.
Ghani also said that his government remains ready to continue talks with the Taliban and, if it meant peace would be secured, he would be willing to end his term early.
On the US forces' withdrawal, he said: “For the Afghan nation, the announcement of the U.S. withdrawal is another phase in our long-term partnership with the United States. Afghanistan has been through consequential withdrawals before.”
Ghani said that the US decision surprised the Taliban and their patrons in Pakistan
“The US decision surprised the Taliban and their patrons in Pakistan, and it has forced them to make a choice. Will they become credible stakeholders, or will they foster more chaos and violence? If the Taliban choose the latter path, the ANDSF will fight them. And if the Taliban still refuse to negotiate, they will be choosing the peace of the grave,” said Ghani in his article.
Ghani said that Afghans cannot and absolutely will not go back to the horrors of the 1990s.

Withdrawal Will Not End War in Afghanistan: Petraeus
","
General David Petraeus, former commander of US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and former CIA director in an interview with has said that the US troops withdrawal from the country “is not going to end the endless war in Afghanistan.”
“It is going to end the US and the coalition involvement in that war militarily” he said in an interview with FRANCE 24 on Tuesday.
US President Joe Biden last month announced that the remaining 2,500 US troops in Afghanistan would leave by September 11.
""I do fear that two to three years from now we are going to look back and regret the decision to withdraw the remaining 3,500 US troops,"" Petraeus said in the interview. ""This is not going to end the endless war in Afghanistan; it is going to end the US and the coalition involvement in that war militarily.""
In addition to the risk of the Taliban gaining ground, Petraeus also warned of the possibility of an Daesh group resurgence in the region.
""I do think there is a risk of the Daesh establishing a sanctuary in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, the very rugged mountainous border area, which is where many of these groups have their headquarters,"" the former top US commander explained.
Reports indicate that US military officials have removed some 60 planeloads of gear from Afghanistan and identified about 1,300 pieces of equipment for destruction by Tuesday.
On May 2, US forces handed over Camp Antonik to Afghan forces in Washir district, Helmand province, according to the Afghan Defense Ministry.
Violence has increased in the country following the start of the US and NATO forces withdrawal from Afghanistan. 
The Ministry of Defense said that at least 80 Taliban were killed in Afghan forces operations in different parts of the country in the last 24 hours.

Rahmon said the expansion of bilateral collaboration between Tajikistan and Afghanistan is at ""the center of his attention."" 
“Tajikistan supports the Afghan government's aspirations to establish security, peace and stability in the country. Dushanbe welcomes the inter-Afghan negotiations that are taking place to this end,” Rahmon said.  
While discussing the issues of providing regional security, the parties noted the importance of strengthening and expanding cooperation in addressing modern challenges and threats, including terrorism, extremism, drug trafficking and organized transnational crime.  
Rahmon also said that his country will continue making efforts to facilitate the solution of problems facing Afghanistan and make contributions to its economic reconstruction.

HCNR Official Expects Istanbul Summit in Late May or Early June
","
Haji Din Mohammad, the deputy head of the High Council of National Reconciliation (HCNR), on Wednesday said that the UN-led conference on Afghanistan is expected to convene in the last week of May or first week of June. Originally, the conference was scheduled for April 24, however, it was postponed due to the lack of participation of the Taliban.
According to Haji Din Mohammad, the Taliban are now in talks with the US about the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from the country, and, according to his analysis, the Americans will completely leave Afghanistan in early July.
Meanwhile, US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in a trip to Tajikistan has said that the main purpose of his regional trips is to gather more support for the peace process in Afghanistan. Khalilzad recently visited Kabul, Qatar and Uzbekistan where he held talks with senior officials of these nations on the peace process in Afghanistan, as the timeline for the Instanbul conference on Afghanistan gets closer.
“The meetings were aimed at how we can cooperate toward bringing peace and stability to Afghanistan,” said Khalilzad.
“The Turks will announce the date as the last week of May or on the first week of June; until then the Taliban and the Americans will be trying to reach an agreement,” said Haji Din Mohammad.
Sources close to the Taliban have also confirmed that the group is currently in talks with the Americans and Taliban’s chief negotiator Mawlavi Abdul Hakim Haqqani is in Pakistan where he is consulting with others.
“Discussions are focused on whether to participate in these talks or not, or whether we (Taliban) should resume attacks on foreign forces or not,” said Mawlavi Jalaluddin Shinwari, the former Taliban attorney general.
The UN-led conference on Afghanistan is considered a critical opportunity to provide an end to the prevailing conflict in Afghanistan.
This comes after a Pakistani delegation led by special envoy Mohammad Sadiq during their two-day visit to Kabul this week assured the Afghan government of the meaningful participation of the Taliban at the Istanbul summit.

Recent waves of fighting between the Afghan security forces and the Taliban in the surrounding areas of Lashkargah city, the center of the southern province of Helmand, have displaced as many as 1,000 families.

“Women and children are in a miserable condition, the Taliban were deployed inside homes, they are still there, we only managed to take one bag and we left behind our other belongings,” said Sediqullah, a displaced person in Helmand.
“What should I bring? The war started in the early morning, the Taliban made their way through the forest, we headed out toward the city, we gathered our children in a vacant shop,” said Gul Agha, a resident of Lashkargah.
Some people who fled their homes are unaware of the status of their loved ones in the Lashkargah area. 
“I brought my two children with me, half of our family fled to a Taliban-controlled area, my husband has remained at home, I don’t know whether he is alive or not,” said Zarmina, a resident of Lashkargah.
""Over 1,000 families have been displaced in Helmand due to the fighting, we had discussions with the NGOs, aid will be distributed to these families soon,” said Sayed Mohammad Ramin, the head of Helmand’s Migration Department.

HCNR Official Calls for Political Consensus to Strengthen Peace
","
Farida Momand, a member of the High Council of National Reconciliation (HCNR), on Wednesday said that mistrust between the political leaders, the people and the government has been the fundamental obstacle to building political consensus in the country for a long time. 
She warned that the peace process will be deadlocked if there is an absence of a powerful consensus between the country’s political leaders, the people and the government, adding that the gap will also lead to the emergence of a new crisis in the country.
This comes days after President Ashraf Ghani, as part of consultations on peace, met with a number of political leaders of the country including former president Hamid Karzai; however, there are no reports about what was discussed in the meetings when it came to the continuation of Ghani’s tenure in office.
“It is very important that the Afghan government moves toward talks with a political consensus, otherwise there will be no benefit of the talks, and the Taliban will exploit it,” said Farida Momand, a member of the HCNR.
“The government has failed over the years to create a political consensus inside the country with the political leaders and the nation,” added Momand.
“There is a need for a powerful high council of government to undertake the management of war and peace in Afghanistan and it shouldn’t only the asset of the Arg (presidential palace) and Sapidar palace,” said Hafizurrahman Naqi, a member of Hizb-e-Islami.
Meanwhile, Ahmad Wali Massoud, the former Afghan ambassador to Britain, has warned that Afghanistan could slip into a new civil war after the withdrawal of foreign forces from the country unless a strong political consensus is forged in the country.
“If they say that we have a consensus to save the post of (Ghani), the people will not accept that. You must be focused on a topic for which the people are in agreement. No doubt all sides want peace,” said Ahmad Wali Massoud, former ambassador to the UK.
The Presidential Palace has said that political consensus has been made about peace and that the president’s meetings with other political leaders were also aimed at promoting further cooperation and consensus between the government and the political elites.

Mujahideen Ready to Fight if Taliban Reject Peace: Massoud
","
Ahmad Massoud, the son of Afghanistan’s National Hero Ahmad Shah Massoud, on Wednesday said that the Afghan mujahideen are ready for a military confrontation with the Taliban if the group does not abide by its commitments to peace.
In a gathering in Kabul, Massoud and former jihadi commanders called on the Afghan people and mujahideen commanders to stay unified, stating that President Ashraf Ghani has been skeptical of the strength of the mujahideen and has sidelined them from the issues at hand.
Massoud said there is no justification for war while the foreign forces are withdrawing from the country.
“In case the parties see a military solution as the way out for Afghanistan, then we will also make our own military preparations within the structure of the mujahideen, with the suggestions of the mujahideen, with the support of the people and under the umbrella of the Ulemas to bring an Islamic system that is the genuine demand of the people,” said Massoud.
“If the negotiations reach a conclusion, that will be good, but if the Taliban tries to enter Kabul with force or seeks to occupy Afghanistan, this wide resistance front should start a revolution against any bullying move,” said Sayed Mohammad Ali Jawed, the head of the Harakat-e-Islami party. 
“The president has no trust in the power and strength of the mujahideen, I pray that neither they nor us become in need of each other,” said Ahmad Massoud.
Critics at the gathering accused some politicians of making deals in pursuit of personal agendas.
Massoud’s warning follows media reports weeks ago that men are taking up arms in Takhar, Baghlan, Daikundi and Baghlan provinces.

Afghan Media Reacts to Killing of Former TOLOnews Anchor

Afghanistan’s journalist community has strongly reacted to the assassination of Nemat Rawan, a former TOLOnews anchor who was killed in an attack by unidentified gunmen in Kandahar on Thursday morning.
The Presidential Palace in a statement condemned the killing of Rawan and denounced the continuation of the war as against Islamic principles.
The Palace described the killing as an act of terrorism.
The Afghan Journalists Safety Committee called on the UN and the Afghan government to ensure the security of journalists and media workers.
“AJSC strongly condemns the assassination of a former presenter, Nemat Rawan. Mr. Rawan newly started his work as a public servant with the Ministry of Finance. We call on the government to seriously investigate the case so perpetrators are brought to justice,” the Afghan Journalists Safety Committee said.
The Presidential Palace said that continuation of violence by the Taliban and the continuation of fighting will further complicate the crisis.
The Taliban’s spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid on Twitter denied the group's involvement in the killing of Rawan.
“All sides must abide by their commitments towards media. Recently the media has been threatened from various sides, this paves the way for other groups to exploit the gaps,” said Hamed Mayar, a journalist.
“Journalists are civilians. An attack on journalists is an attack on civilians and it is a war crime,” said Sediqullah Tawhidi, a journalist.
Other journalists said that such killings serve to demoralize independent journalists.
“Both the Afghan government and the Taliban directly and indirectly threaten media, this is something to put a knee on the neck of press freedom,” said Sayed Ahmad Abrar, a journalist. 
“Terrorists have always tried to target the elites of the society to weaken the morale of the journalists and media,” said Esmatullah Ahmadzai, a journalist.
Those journalists who lost their lives in 2020 are: 
Safar Mohammad Atal, an anchor of Samson Radio in Helmand;
Ahmad Khan Nawid, an anchor of Ghor Radio in Feroz koh city;
Mir Wahid Shah Amiri, Khorshid TV reporter in Kabul;

Elyas Daee, a Radio Azadi reporter in Helmand;
Malala Maiwand, Eekas TV anchor in Nangarhar;
Rahmatullah Nekzad, a freelance reporter in Ghazni; and Tahir Khan, a driver at Enekas TV in Nangarhar.
On the first day of 2021, a reporter, Bismillah Adil Aimaq, was killed in an attack by unknown armed men in Ghor. He was head of a local radio station in the province.
According to a recent report by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, at least 11 human rights defenders and media workers were killed in targeted attacks in Afghanistan from September 2020 through to January 31, 2021.
A total of 65 human rights defenders and media professionals were killed in the period from January 1, 2018, to January 31, 2021, it said.
On April 2, Human Rights Watch accused the Taliban of ""deliberately targeting journalists and other media workers, including women,"" in Afghanistan, saying that such attacks and threats have increased sharply since the start of the talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban in Doha.
The watchdog says these attacks increase concerns about preserving freedom of expression and the media in any peace settlement.
Human Rights Watch (HRW) says it has found that “the Taliban commanders and fighters have engaged in a pattern of threats, intimidation, and violence against members of the media in areas where the Taliban have significant influence, as well as in Kabul.”

NATO Seeks Ways to Continue Support to Afghan Forces: Stoltenberg
","
Speaking at a meeting of European Union Defense Ministers on Thursday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that the drawdown of NATO troops in Afghanistan was underway, but that the end of the Alliance’s mission does not mean the end of NATO’s relationship with Afghanistan. 
He said that NATO allies are looking at how they can continue to provide financial and training support to Afghan forces, the Secretary General said.
“We have sent a very clear to Taliban that any attack on NATO troops will be met with a forceful response,” Stoltenberg said. “The drawdown of NATO troops and the end of the Resolute Support mission is not the end to our partnership with Afghanistan; it’s actually opening of a new chapter and we are now looking into how we can continue to provide support.”
He added: “We are looking into ways to provide financial support, help with training and also support international community in Afghanistan.”
Stoltenberg said that NATO strongly supported the peace process and negotiated peaceful solution to the conflict in Afghanistan is the best way to maintain the achievements we have made together over the last decades.
US and NATO troops last month announced to end the withdrawal process by Sept. 11. So far, two bases have been handed over to Afghan forces by international troops since May 1, according to the Defense Ministry.

Envoys Oppose Establishment of Any Govt in Afghanistan By Force
","
Special envoys and special representatives of the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, NATO, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States in a statement emphasized the need for continued international support to Afghan National Defense and Security Forces and said it will be necessary to ensure Afghanistan can defend itself against internal and external threats.
The envoys acknowledged the widespread and sincere demand of the Afghan people for an end to the war and a fair and lasting peace and confirmed that such a peace can only be achieved through an inclusive, negotiated political settlement among Afghans, according to the statement that was published by Germany’s Foreign Office on Friday.
They affirmed their commitment to UNSC resolution 2513 (2020) and emphasized that they oppose the establishment in Afghanistan of any government by force which would constitute a threat to regional stability.
The envoys highlighted the need to accelerate the pace of the Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace negotiations and committed to work with the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, the Taliban, and other Afghan political and civil society leaders to reach a comprehensive and sustainable peace agreement and political compromise that ends the war for the benefit of all Afghans and that contributes to regional stability and global security.
They underlined their support for the continuation of discussions between the parties’ negotiating teams in Doha and urged the immediate resumption, without pre-conditions, of substantive negotiations on the future of Afghanistan with the aim to develop and negotiate realistic compromise positions on power-sharing that can lead to an inclusive and legitimate government and a just and durable settlement.
The envoys welcomed an expanded role for the United Nations in contributing to the Afghanistan peace and reconciliation process, including by leveraging its considerable experience and expertise in supporting other peace processes.
They strongly condemned the continued violence in Afghanistan for which the Taliban are largely responsible and demanded all parties to take immediate and necessary steps to reduce violence and in particular, to avoid civilian casualties in order to create an environment conducive to reaching a political settlement.
The participants called upon the Taliban to stop their undeclared spring offensive, to refrain from attacks against civilians, and to stop immediately all attacks in the vicinity of hospitals, schools, universities, mosques and other civilian areas. 
The envoys, in particular, demanded an immediate end to the campaign of targeted assassinations against civil society leaders, the clergy, journalists and other media workers, human rights defenders, healthcare personnel, judicial employees and other civilians.
The envoys said that the process of the troop withdrawal must not serve as an excuse for the Taliban to suspend the peace process and that good-faith political negotiations must proceed in earnest.
They also agreed that substantial international development assistance will be needed for Afghanistan’s stability during peace negotiations and reaffirmed their commitment to mobilize international support for reconstruction following a peace agreement, based on the conditions as laid out in the outcome documents of the 2020 Geneva Conference, including the preservation and respect for the rights of all Afghans, including women and minorities. 
They reaffirmed that any peace agreement must protect the rights of all Afghans, including women, youth and minorities, and must respond to the strong desire of Afghans to sustain and build on the economic, social, political and development gains achieved since 2001, including greater adherence to the rule of law, respect for Afghanistan’s international obligations, and improvements in inclusive and accountable governance. 
The special representatives underscored that the Taliban and the Government of the Islamic Republic must fulfill their counterterrorism commitments including to prevent al-Qaida, Daesh or other terrorist groups and individuals from using Afghan soil to threaten or violate the security of any other country; not to host members of these groups; and to prevent them from recruiting, training or fundraising.
They reaffirmed that current and future support to any Afghan government relies on the adherence to the principles set out in the Afghanistan Partnership Framework and progress towards the outcomes in the Afghanistan National Peace and Development Framework II as decided upon at the November 2020 Geneva donor’s conference.
The participants called upon the Government of the Islamic Republic to effectively fight corruption and promote good governance, and implement anti-corruption legislation.
They urged the Taliban to facilitate access for delivery of humanitarian aid, without preconditions and in accordance with international humanitarian law, to the parts of the country under their effective control.
The envoys encouraged all concerned countries, in particular Afghanistan’s neighbors and countries of the region, to continue to support the Afghan people and constructively contribute to a lasting peace settlement and sustainable economic development in the interest of all.

Afghan Delegation Heads to The Hague for Talks with ICC Officials
","
A delegation led by Foreign Minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar left for The Netherlands to hold talks with the International Criminal Court prosecutor. 
Justice Minister Fazel Ahmad Manawi, Acting Attorney General Zabihullah Kalim, and a number of senior government officials and judiciary and security experts are part of the delegation, according to a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The International Criminal Court (ICC) operates under the Rome Statute, and Afghanistan has been a member of the Tribunal since 2003. 
The International Criminal Court shall use its complementary jurisdiction to assist the Member States in dealing with international crimes, including genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression, the statement says.
The statement says that based on the principle of complementarity jurisdiction and at the request of war victims and human rights organizations, the ICC has gathered complaints on alleged commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the last years of imposed war in Afghanistan and demands practical and direct investigation thereof.
In accordance with its international obligations, the Afghan government has already submitted its performance report to the Tribunal on investigating and prosecuting all relevant cases and intends during this visit to furnish further assurances to the ICC on Afghanistan’s willingness and action plan to address the alleged international crimes, the statement says.
To address crimes committed in the country following Afghanistan’s accession to the ICC and to prevent such crimes from happening in the future, the Afghan government will seek assistance and support from the Office of the ICC Prosecutor. 
The request [for assistance] will be made based on the principle of the country’s judicial independence and provisions of the Rome Statute, the statement says.
The Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan seeks to strengthen the existing peace process and ensure immediate and permanent ceasefire, by securing ICC’s cooperation with Afghanistan’s judiciary organs in addressing crimes and preventing them from happening in the future, the ministry said. 
The ministry said that the two sides will discuss the mechanisms for deferral of investigations to the Afghan judiciary organs and establishing technical and capacity building cooperation.
This comes as the United States last month lifted sanctions on the International Criminal Court's (ICC) senior members, including a prosecutor who had launched an investigation into alleged war crimes by US military personnel in Afghanistan.
Announcing the decision, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that assessment concluded that the measures adopted by the previous administration “were inappropriate and ineffective.”
The Trump administration had imposed financial sanctions and a US visa ban on the ICC’s Gambian-born chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda last year after she launched an investigation into alleged war crimes committed by American forces in Afghanistan, according to US media reports.

We will work toward our common goals in some new and different ways,” Austin said at a joint press conference with Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
“The Afghan National Security Forces and the government of Afghanistan at this time remain cohesive. The president of United States intent is to continue to support both the ANSF and the government of Afghanistan,” said Milley.

Taliban Attacks Repelled in Multiple Fronts as Fighting Escalates
","
Heavy fighting is underway in several fronts across Afghanistan after Taliban launched attacks on the Afghan security forces’ security outposts in various regions of Ghazni, Maidan Wardak, Laghman, Baghlan and Helmand provinces over the last 24 hours. 
In the latest wave of violent incident, Taliban stormed two security outposts in Arezo village on the outskirts of Ghazni city, killing at least 16 security force members and injuring three more.
In Maidan Wardak province, local officials have confirmed that in Maidan Shar city, three soldiers apparently associated with the Taliban opened fire and killed ten soldiers and then fled to a Taliban-controlled area along their military equipment.
The Afghan Ministry of Defense said that the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) have dealt major blows to the Taliban during the recent spate of violence in various parts of the country.
“Heavy casualties were inflicted to the enemy particularly in Helmand, Baghlan, Ghazni, Maidan Wardak and Kandahar provinces. The security forces are crushing terrorists with more strength than ever before,” said Rohullah Ahmadzai, spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.
Ahmadzai said that the ANDSF stormed a gathering of high-profile Taliban members in Bolan area outside Lashkargah city and killed a key Taliban commander and wounded their shadow governors.
“At least six security force members were martyred following their resistance against the Taliban in Arezo village of Ghazni, three more solders were wounded. Likewise, 12 other (soldiers) were taken hostage by the Taliban. In the second outpost, no resistance occurred and eight soldiers surrendered to the Taliban,” said Hassan Reza Yousufi, member of Ghazni provincial council.
“It is not right that the government evacuate outposts or districts and deploy in the center of the cities. We should take the war from the centers to the districts and to the remote areas,” said Khan Agha Rezayee, the head of parliament’s internal security commission.
In western Afghanistan, at least 23 Taliban fighters were killed and 27 others were wounded after the Afghan Air Force targeted a gathering of local Taliban commanders in Bala Buluk district of the province, local officials said.
Farah governor Taj Mohammad Jahid said that the air strike was carried out on Friday in Shewan village of Bala Buluk.
 Taliban has also claimed that their fighters fired several missiles on a security base in the area.
“The Taliban once again proved their dark face. They massacred the hostages,” said Dadullah Qane, the head of Farah provincial council.

US Sends More Warplanes to Protect Afghan Withdrawal
","
The United States has deployed a dozen additional warplanes to protect the withdrawal of American and coalition troops from Afghanistan as Taliban mounts pressure on Afghan forces, Pentagon officials said Thursday.
Military Times quoted Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, as saying that F-18 attack planes have been added to a previously announced package of air and sea power, including the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the North Arabian Sea and six Air Force B-52 bombers based in Qatar, that can be called upon as protection for withdrawing troops.
Also part of that previously announced package are several hundred Army Rangers, according to Military Times report.
“There continue to be sustained levels of violent attacks” by the Taliban against Afghan security forces, Milley said, speaking alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at a Pentagon news conference.
He said there have been no attacks against US or coalition forces since they began pulling out of the country on about May 1, and he described the Afghan forces as “cohesive,” even as speculation swirls around Kabul’s ability to hold off the Taliban in the months ahead.
“They’re fighting for their own country now, so it’s not a foregone conclusion, in my professional military estimate, that the Taliban automatically win and Kabul falls, or any of those kinds of dire predictions,” Milley said. “That’s not a foregone conclusion. There’s a significant military capability in the Afghan government. We have to see how this plays out.”
He said the Pentagon is considering options for continued support of Afghan government forces after the troop withdrawal is complete, including possibly training Afghan security forces in another country.
That would be in addition to urging the Congress to authorize continued financial assistance to the Afghan forces, which has been in the range of $4 billion a year for many years, and possibly providing aircraft maintenance support remotely from another country, according to Military Times.
“We haven’t figured that out 100% yet,” Milley said.
Milley said Afghanistan’s air force is central to the strategy for holding off the Taliban, but the durability of those planes is in some doubt.
This comes as Taliban violence has increased following the start of the withdrawal of US and coalition forces from Afghanistan. The Defense Ministry reported Saturday that 250 Taliban fighters were killed in clashes against the Afghan forces in nine provinces over the last 24 hours.

Taliban Has No Intention for A Military Takeover: Top Negotiator

Taliban does not intend to seize power through military struggle, said Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai, a top negotiator for the Taliban in Doha, as the timeline for a US-proposed peace conference on Afghanistan in Turkey approaches.
Stanekzai made the remarks during a virtual meeting with envoys from the UN, Norway, Sweden, Germany, US and the UK.
Stanekzai clarified that forming a coalition government was not a solution to the conflict, stating that there is need for a strong centralized Islamic government in which the rights of every Afghan citizen is protected, not a few.
“The Islamic Emirate ( the term used for Taliban movement) does not accept a coalition government. There is a need for a strong centralized Islamic system, a system in which every Afghan see their rights, not a few people, a system in which the rights of every Afghan national is reflected,” said Stanekzai.
He also said that the conditional release of 7,000 Taliban prisoners and the removal of names of Taliban leaders from the UN blacklist were a key to move the peace process forward.
“Whenever a member of our delegation wants to go and meet our leaders or military commanders, it takes them days and this causes disruption in the peace process,” said Stanekzai, indirectly asking the removal of Taliban’s names from the UN blacklist.
The Taliban negotiator also assured that Afghan women will be allowed to play a role in the political process of the country and that freedom of speech will be operating within the framework of Islamic Sharia.

A Closer Look at the Kabul School Bombing
","
It was a quiet Saturday afternoon and hundreds of girls were leaving the school when the deadly incident occurred. Suddenly many students found themselves among smoke and blood and debris from a car bomb attack that happened in front of the entrance gate of Sayed-ul-Shuhada High School in the west of Kabul.
The car bomb attack was followed by two IED blasts that were placed nearby, according to the Ministry of Interior, which put the death toll at 52. But eyewitnesses and victims’ relatives said 63 people--most of whom were schoolgirls--were killed and at least 150 more were wounded.
Residents said the students were leaving the school when the car bomb detonated.
Two more blasts happened shortly after the first.
No group has so far claimed responsibility for the attack.
The school enrolls over 7,000 students in two shifts. The late shift, in which the blasts happened, contained at least 2,000 girls.
Videos shared on social media show victims’ families tirelessly searching for their loved ones whose bags and clothes were left in the area, ripped open by the blast.
“All are innocent children… All are underage girls. All were martyred mercilessly. One didn’t have legs, another didn’t have a head,” said Abdul Latif, a resident of the Dasht-e-Barchi area in Kabul.
“The car (that exploded) was parked there from 1pm that day… And the incident happened after 4pm. If you do not see this Mr. Ashraf Ghani, leave the power, and don’t bother people,” said Hadi, a resident of Dasht-e-Barchi in Kabul.
All of the students who were killed or wounded were under 18 years old.
“The enemies of the people of Afghanistan and the enemies of Islam will never be able to defeat us by such acts. We will send our children to school to defeat their enemies with education and pen,” said Marzia, a resident of the area.
“It shows the cruelty of the terrorist groups who killed our children and youth to fuel a psychological war,” said Mahmoud Abdullah, a resident of the area.
Om Sunday, the relatives of the victims were still searching for the belongings of their loved ones at the blast scene. Sunday afternoon. Sediqa Jafari, who is blind and lives in the area, said they are tired and there is no more space for them to suffer such pain.
“Anyone who does this in this holy month will be defeated and is a cruel enemy. It is evident who does this,” Sediqa said.
Two more attacks targeted education centers in the west of Kabul in less than two years, killing dozens of students.
“We are working thoroughly to find the perpetrators of the case to punish them,” Interior Ministry’s spokesman Tariq Arian said.
Dasht-e-Barchi residents said the repeat of deadly attacks in the west of Kabul shows that the government “has failed” to ensure the safety of the area.

Most School Attack Victims Were From Low-Income Families
","
The triple blasts near a school in the west of Kabul on Saturday took 63 lives, many of whom were female students from poor families living in Dasht-e-Barchi, one of the most low-income areas in Kabul.
Their ages ranged from 13 to 18 years old and they were attending classes from 7 to 12th grade at school. Some of them paid their expenses from carpet weaving.
Kamila, 13, was the only literate person in her family. She sought education to help her family get of their current economic situation. Gulsoom, 17, another victim, wanted to become a pilot.
The school is located near a hillside, surrounded by mostly one-story houses, most of which are made of mud.
“She did carpet weaving at nights and studied during the day so that she could continue her education and afford her expenses,” Kamila’s mother said.
“It is hard for me to go to school and study because we have lost our hope in the government,” said Zahra, Kamila’s sister.
Tahira, who shared a class with her sister Gilsoom--who was killed--survived the attack but is wounded. Tahira, too, paid for her and her family’s needs with carpet weaving.
“She earned 200 Afs a day and spent it for her needs at school,” Gulsoom’s mother Masooma said.
“Our family said she should not go to school because her future would not be guaranteed, but I insisted that she should go to school because it was a state school,” said Husain, the brother of a victim.
Raihana, another victim, also wanted to become a pilot.
Kamila, who was killed in the blast, wanted to become a police officer, according to their relatives.
“I saw the first body, I saw the second, and the third was my own Raihana,” said Mohammad Ali, Raihana’s father.
“We went to school together that day. She (Raihana) was very happy compared to other days. She told me that she was very happy that day,” said Habiba, Raihana’s sister.
Tahira says her wounds from the blast are minor but the pain from losing her sister has given her a bigger pain.
Families of the students said they have lost their hope for the future as they have no idea if they will be able to continue to send their children to school.

Survivors of Kabul School Attack: We Will Never Quit
","
Students who survived the deadly bombings outside a school in western Kabul on Saturday vowed to continue their education despite having lost dozens of classmates in the deadly incident that killed 63 people and wounded over 150 others.
Their families said that such incidents are an attack on Afghanistan’s future, and they dampen the students’ desire to get an education. 
The attack started with a car bomb explosion outside Sayed-ul-Shuhada High school as hundreds of girls were leaving the school, which is located on a hillside in the Dasht-e-Barchi area in Kabul’s District 13. 
The surviving students said the only way to defeat Afghanistan’s enemies is through education. 
“We will resume from where we fall… No one and nothing will impede us from getting an education,” said Madina Nekzad, a student. 
“I am very upset, but we want to continue on this path. We will never surrender,” said Frozan, a student. 
Mobina, a student at a private school in Dasht-e-Barchi who visited those wounded from the incident, said the pain of losing friends and families in such incidents is very oppressive.
She expressed her feelings by reading a poem: “We will enter the ground stronger… Our pen will be our weapon… We will fight them with the pen… I now have realized that they are afraid of us because they stabbed us from behind.” 
“We went without dinners to afford money for their books and notebooks so they could one day support us. But now what will be our chances for the future be in sending them to school?"" asked a teacher. 
Victims’ families said that the attack on children and innocent teenagers is not condoned by any religion. 
“What was their sin? What law has allowed such a massacre?” asked a relative of the victims. 
This comes as a car bomb attack killed dozens of students in Logar province last week, leading President Ghani to say that education in the country is under attack.

Afghans Condemn 'Cowardly', 'Inhuman' School Attack
","
Afghans from various parts of the country condemned in strong terms the deadly bombings on Saturday near a girls’ school in the west of Kabul, calling it a 'cowardly' and 'inhuman' act and said they will never forgive the perpetrators.
The attack that happened during the last days of Ramadhan sparked a strong reaction from Afghans who have suffered from war for the last four decades.
“Even an infidel will not do this,” said Mohammad Ali, a Kabul resident.
“I am not sure what was the logic. They are the most illogical people on earth,” said Khalilullah Shankar, a Kabul resident.
Residents of other provinces also condemned the attack and called it a cruel act.
“Children and students have been killed. It is a big tragedy,” said Zahirullah Zahir, a resident of Nangarhar.
“How long will this violence continue? It has continued for 20 years,” said Fazl Ahmad Ataee, a resident of Herat.
Religious scholars said the killing of Muslims, particularly children, is against all principles and teachings of Islam, and reiterated that the perpetrators’ place will be in hell.
“The Almighty Allah says in the Quran that anyone who kills a person deliberately, he will be in hell forever,” said Zabihullah Atiq, a member of the religious scholars’ council in Badakhshan.
“Islam is a religion of kindness and forgiveness. The attack that happened yesterday and other attacks in which civilians are killed--Islam sees it as crime and violence,” said Abdul Qadir Qanet, head of the religious council of Kabul.
Some lawmakers meanwhile called the attack inhuman and blamed the government for failing to prevent such incidents.
“The government should act responsibly to defend its citizens,” said Qayum Sajjadi, an MP from Ghazni. “Our people cannot see failures and inefficiencies of the security agencies anymore.”
Politicians said the attack showed the cruelness of the attackers who did not show mercy, even for children.
“The killers stained Kabul with blood. They martyred our innocent children,” said Fazl Hadi Muslimyar, speaker of the Senate.
“It is evident that terrorists always do terror,” said Anarkali Hunaryar, a senator.
“I call on the international community to please have mercy on Afghans' situation and make efforts,” said Fawzia Sadat Samkanai, a Senator.
The car bomb attack that happened near Sayed-ul-Shuhada school in the west of Kabul on Saturday was followed by two IED blasts and killed 63 people while wounding over 150 others.

Ghani Declares Tuesday a National Day of Mourning
","
President Ghani declares Tuesday a national day of mourning for the victims of the Kabul and Logar bombings, which killed scores of students.
He says a funeral will be held for the martyrs around the country.
He said that he has directed the first vice president to provide money to the victims’ families.
President Ghani, in a recorded message about the Kabul school attack, says that as the father of two children he shares the pain with every family that was affected in the deadly incident.
He said the attack on innocent people, especially students, was a crime against humanity, and the perpetrators will be hated by Afghans.
Ghani said that he has directed his second vice president to work on a security plan in consultation with the residents in the west of Kabul and report back to him within two weeks.
He said that he has he directed the Ministry of Public Health to provide support to those wounded in the attack.
Ghani said that “ignorant” groups-- sometimes under the Taliban name and sometimes under the Daesh name--show with such cruel attacks they want to prevent the education of Afghan children and weaken the people's trust in a brotherly future.
Ghani said he has directed the national development company to reconstruct the Sayed ul Shuhada girls school to allow “our children to go back to school.”
“The Taliban should realize that they will not achieve their evil goals through war and if they do not quit killing the people they will be further hated by the people and will be heavily suppressed by the Afghan forces,” he concluded.
According to sources and relatives of victims, 63 people, all students, were killed in a Kabul school bombing and 150 more were wounded.
Meanwhile, at least 26 people, most of them students, were killed in a car bomb attack in Logar late last month.

Victims of Kabul School Bombing, All Teenagers, Laid to Rest
","
Over 60 victims of the school bombing--most of whom were students and younger than 18 years old-- were buried on a hill in the west of Kabul on Sunday, a day after the deadly attack.
Their families said that most of the victims were teenage girls who studied at Sayed-ul-Shuhada High School in the Dasht-e-Barchi area in Kabul’s District 13. These girls, their families said, were faced with many hardships but were eager to pursue their studies and make a brighter future for themselves.
The mourning families said the government has ignored the people and has failed to ensure their safety. They say they have lost hope in the government.
Many parents collected bloodstained notebooks, books, bags, and pens belonging to their slain daughters who would no longer need them.
“Only this has remained from her. Nothing more is in this notebook, except some English words,” said Shir Hazara, a relative of a victim. “This notebook has been stained with the martyr who owned it.”
Atifa, 13, who lost her life in the attack, was interested in becoming an architect to change her family’s life for the better.
“We searched until 11 pm at night but we could not find her. We found her at 12 am at Ali Jinnah Hospital,” said Atifa’s father Mohammad Nasir who is a painter.
“They should refrain from such acts. This is inhumane,” said Mohammad Hakim, Atifa’s uncle.
Gulsoom, another victim, wanted to become a teacher.
“I recognized her from her bag that was near the school. Her books were inside it,” said Ehsanullah, Gulsoom’s father.
“When she (Gulsoom) was going to school yesterday, my mother asked her not to go because she had some work to do, but she told my mother that she will go today and she will not go the day after,” Gulsoom’s brother said.
All those who were laid to rest on the hill were between 13 and 18 years old, according to their parents. They all were daughters of parents who worked as laborers.
“We buried 26 martyrs on this hill that has been named the Hill of Education. We buried 20 more martyrs on another hill and 17 more were buried in Chehel Dokhtaran Hill near the school,” said Mohammad Daud, the relative of a victim.
It is not the first time that the west of Kabul has had an attack on an education center. Last year, a tuition center was targeted by a suicide bomber in which dozens of students were killed.

Survivors of School Attack Recall Ordeal

Out of 150 people wounded in the Kabul school bombing, at least 50 were taken to the state-owned Ali Jinnah Hospital in Kabul, where one of the teenagers who was critically wounded succumbed to her injuries on Sunday morning.
The wounded who underwent surgery remembered the ordeal, during which they lost their closest classmates and friends.
Those injured in the deadly bombing were taken for treatment to at least 12 hospitals in Kabul.
Hamida, a teenage student, said her right hand has been broken in the explosion. Her father is a day laborer. She said she did not have the money to buy medicine and other required equipment for the surgery of her broken hand.
“I hope she gets well soon,” said Mohammad Akbar, Hamida’s father.
Hamida’s parents said they lost all hope for their daughter following the explosion as they searched for her for hours.
Hamida said she is traumatized and she loses consciousness when she remembers the deadly attack and seeing the remains and belongings of her classmates that surrounded her following the first blast.
“I remember very bad things… Like the burned bodies,” Hamida said, while shedding tears.
Zahra, 15, who succumbed to her injuries, was in the 10th grade at the school. Her mother said they have four children, and all were enrolled in government schools as they could not afford the tuition at private schools.
“Their clothes were burned. They were stained with dust,” Zahra’s mother, Masooma, said.
Zainab, 13, was wounded when she was buying a pen from a shop in front of the school when the blast happened. Although she was injured, she started the search for her elder sister after the explosion, she said.
Zainab’s father, Mohammad Arif, said that he would have sent his children to better schools if he had the financial ability.
“I work one day, and I can find no work for three more days… I earn up to 7,000 Afs each month,” Arif said.
Of the 50 wounded who were taken to Ali Jinah Hospital, five were in the emergency ward on Sunday.
“There were some martyrs whose identities were not known. The family of one of them was found this morning -- many of them were burned,” said Jawed Akbar, a chief physician at the hospital.

Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, in a statement on ceasefire announcement by Taliban said that “temporary ceasefires” are not permanent solution to the country's problems,” stressing the need for permanent ceasefire to end the war in the country.
“We believe that the solution to the current crisis in the country is to speed up negotiations, declare a permanent ceasefire and end the war,” Abdullah said.
“Previously, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan had declared unilateral ceasefire on Eid days and special occasions,” Abdullah said. “Temporary ceasefires on these occasions provides a brief opportunity for people to peace but is not a fundamental and permanent solution to the country's problems.”
Abdullah said that there is no military solution to Afghanistan’s crisis. 
“The experience of the last four decades shows that the version of violence and killing is not only the solution but has added to the depth of the crisis and conflict,” he said, adding that “for this reason, no group should make a miscalculation will reach to a result by more killings and violence.”

“Our message to the Taliban is that their latest attacks during Ramadan in Logar, Helmand, Ghazni, Herat, Baghlan, the Kabul school attack, and today’s (Monday) deadly incident in Zabul show that any attempt to impose violence and make efforts to create horror among the people to achieving political and intelligence goals only leads to more hatred (towards them) among the people,” Ghani said.

Arguments Erupt in Parliament Over Kabul School Attack
","
Afghan parliament’s Monday session was disrupted following verbal clashes between MPs over Saturday's deadly attack on the Kabul school, with some lawmakers calling it a genocide, while others characterized it as the killing of Afghans.
The attack left over 60 people killed, all teenage students, and over 150 wounded.
Some lawmakers meanwhile called for the removal of security heads. They said that the government should ensure the safety of the people instead of mourning such incidents.
“When the intelligence agency and other relevant organizations are so unaware, then what is the logic behind their existence?” said Shahgul Rezaee, an MP from Ghazni.
Some lawmakers said that the security agencies, particularly the intelligence apparatus, have failed to protect the people against such incidents.
“Genocide has occurred in one particular area in the last five years. This has no past in Afghanistan’s history,” said Arif Rahmani, an MP from Ghazni.
“Anyone in the parliament who supports this crime, he will be part of the killers of Afghan people,” said Ghulam Husain Naseri, an MP from Kabul.
But some lawmakers said that any attack of this kind is aimed at the killing of Afghans and that such attacks are not genocide.
“We condemn it in the strongest terms. These are terms that are repeated often by government officials, but the public is tired of such repeated sentences,” said Gul Ahmad Kamin, an MP from Kandahar.
The differences were fueled when Logar MP Shahpoor Hassanzoi accused some of his colleagues who called the attack a genocide of spying for other countries.
Referring to such statements, Hassanzoi said: “This is backed by Iran. It has its own agents at the Wolesi Jirga here.”
“They have just buried their children because of a cruel act by terrorists. Instead of condolences, they are increasing their pain,” said Qayum Sajjadi, an MP from Ghazni.
However, the parliament speaker Mir Rahman Rahmani said that the country’s enemies want to disrupt unity among the people by conducting such heinous attacks.
“The anti-knowledge and anti-education created a tragedy by attacking the children and the Sayed-ul-Shuhada school in this holy month,” Rahmani said.
“All Afghans condemn this attack,” said Naeem Wardak, an MP from Maidan Wardak.

President Ghani said that the war in Afghanistan does not have a military solution. He said that the Taliban’s insistence on a military solution is not acceptable for Afghan people who want a just and enduring peace through negotiations.  
  
He said stability in both countries is connected with the other and called for a sincere role to be played by Pakistan in ensuring a just and enduring peace in Afghanistan.  
  
Bajwa also met with Abdullah Abdullah, head of the High Council for National Reconciliation.  
  
In this meeting, Bajwa said that his country believes that there is no military solution in Afghanistan and that the only way is through achieving a political solution via negotiations and agreement on the establishment of an all-inclusive government, according to a statement by Abdullah’s office.  
  
Abdullah said the Taliban wants to impose a military solution but this will prolong the violence and will fuel people’s opposition against the group.  
  
He added that a peaceful Afghanistan in which the Taliban would be a part of its system is favored by Afghans, regional countries and the world.  
  
Abdullah reiterated that a military solution is not practical and is not acceptable for the people of Afghanistan.   
  
Both sides stressed the need for meaningful negotiations between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban, the statement said.  
  
Bajwa’s trip to Kabul comes as the Taliban has announced ceasefire for three days of Eid. President Ghani also ordered Afghan forces to observe the ceasefire, but he reiterated that there should be an agreement from the Taliban for a permanent and real ceasefire which is the demand of the people and the government of Afghanistan.

Jerusalem Violence Leads to Rockets, Air Strikes
","
Violent clashes over Jerusalem escalated dramatically on Monday with Gaza health officials saying at least 20 people, including nine children, were killed by Israeli air strikes launched after Palestinian militant groups fired rockets close to Jerusalem.
Israel’s military said it carried out strikes against armed groups, rocket launchers and military posts in Gaza after militants there crossed what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a “red line” by firing on the Jerusalem area for the first time since a 2014 war. 
The rocket fire and Israeli air strikes continued late into the night, with Palestinians reporting loud explosions close to Gaza City and across the coastal strip. Shortly before midnight local time, Israel’s military said Palestinian militants had fired around 150 rockets into Israel, of which dozens were intercepted by its missile defence systems. 
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the rocket attacks from Gaza against Israel should stop “immediately.” He urged all sides to take steps to reduce tensions. 
Monday began with early-morning confrontations at Al-Aqsa Mosque in the heart of Jerusalem’s walled Old City on the compound known to Jews as Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary - the most sensitive site in the Israel-Palestinian conflict. 
The Palestine Red Crescent Society said more than 300 Palestinians were injured in clashes with Israeli police, who fired rubber bullets, stun grenades and tear gas in the compound. Police said 21 officers were hurt in the skirmishes. 
The upsurge in violence came as Israel celebrated “Jerusalem Day”, marking its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. 
In an effort to defuse tensions, police changed the route of a traditional Jerusalem Day march, in which thousands of Israeli flag-waving Jewish youth were due to walk through the Old City near Damascus Gate, a flashpoint in recent weeks. 
But although the trouble had died down by mid-morning, there were other focal points of tension, including the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of East Jerusalem just north of the Old City where several Palestinian families face eviction from homes claimed by Jewish settlers in a long-running legal case. 
Demanding that Israel remove its police from Al-Aqsa and Sheikh Jarrah, Hamas, the Islamist militant group that controls Gaza, set a 6 p.m. (1500 GMT) deadline for the forces to be withdrawn. 
Even as the marchers were diverted toward Jaffa Gate, sirens sounded alerting Israelis to incoming rockets from Gaza, forcing the marchers and other Israelis to flee for cover in Jerusalem, nearby towns and in Israeli communities near Gaza. 
Israel views all of Jerusalem as its capital, including the eastern part that it annexed after the 1967 war in a move that has not won international recognition. Palestinians want East Jerusalem for the capital of a state they seek in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. 
Tension had been building for weeks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, amid clashes between Israeli security forces and Palestinian protesters prompting international concern that events could spiral out of control. 
Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group claimed responsibility for the rocket fire on Jerusalem. 
Abu Ubaida, a spokesman for Hamas’s armed wing, said it had launched “a rocket strike against the enemy in the occupied Jerusalem in response to their crimes and aggression against the holy city and its aggression against our people in Sheikh Jarrah and Al-Aqsa mosque.” 
In response, Netanyahu said: “The terrorist organisations crossed a red line on Jerusalem Day and attacked us, on the outskirts of Jerusalem.” 
He added: “Israel will respond very forcefully. We will not tolerate attacks on our territory, our capital, our citizens and our soldiers. Whoever strikes us will pay a heavy price.” 
VIOLENCE AROUND AL-AQSA MOSQUE 
For Hamas, some commentators said, its challenge to Israel was a sign to Palestinians that it rather than Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was now calling the shots in holding Israel accountable for events in Jerusalem. 
Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus said that at least six of the rockets fired from Gaza were launched towards Jerusalem’s outskirts, where a house was hit. No casualties were reported. 
“We have started to attack Hamas military targets,” Conricus said in a briefing to reporters, putting no timeframe on any Israeli offensive. “Hamas will pay a heavy price.” 
He said the military was looking into reports that children had been killed. 
“We had multiple events of rockets fired by Gaza terrorists falling short. This might be the same,” Conricus said. 
Along the fortified Gaza-Israeli border, a Palestinian anti-tank missile fired from the tiny coastal territory struck a civilian vehicle, injuring one Israeli, he said. 
After learning of the deaths in Gaza, President Abbas decided to cancel celebrations of the upcoming Eid El-Fitr that marks the end of Ramadan, and limit them to religious rituals only, according to a statement published by the official WAFA news agency. 
The report said he also decided to lower flags to half-mast “to mourn the souls of the martyrs of our people who were killed in the Israeli bombardment on Gaza Strip.” 
International efforts to stem the violence appeared to have already begun. A Palestinian official told Reuters that Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations, which have mediated truces between Israel and Hamas in the past, were in contact with the group’s leader Ismail Haniyeh.

Khalilzad Says US Stands with Afghans
","
US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad on Monday welcomed the announcements by the Afghan government and the Taliban to observe an Eid ceasefire, and said “violence has been horrific in recent weeks, and the Afghan people have paid the price,” reiterating that the United States stands with the people of Afghanistan.
Khalilzad said that Afghans need “a political settlement and a permanent ceasefire.""
He called for accelerated negotiations among Afghans on a political settlement and ""an end to this senseless war. 
""This is what the Afghan people yearn for,"" he added.
Khalilzad also in an interview with Der Spiegel published on Monday has said that the Afghan people are longing for peace and that there has to be peace and there is no better alternative.
“The Taliban spoke to the US and the European group in Berlin this week by video. They said they don't see a military solution and say that the only option is a political one. Both sides have to be realistic about finding common ground. If there is no peace agreement, the alternative is not a Taliban victory. It is a long war,” he said in the interview.
On Monday, President Ashraf Ghani in a statement instructed all Afghan forces to observe the ceasefire during three days of Eid, but he reiterated that the Taliban’s violence has no legitimacy as international troops are leaving the country.
Ghani stated that the government is aware of the announcement of the ceasefire by the Taliban, but he did not welcome it or otherwise acknowledge the gesture in his remarks.
Ghani said the Afghan government and the Afghan people’s demand is a permanent and real ceasefire.
He said that the Taliban in the last few weeks might have learned that their calculation of winning militarily and in face-to-face fights against the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces is wrong.
He once again called on the Taliban to respond to the people’s demand for ceasefire and return to the negotiating table.
The Taliban in a statement announced a three-day ceasefire during the upcoming Eid-ul-Fitr, following a surge of violence that comes on the heels of the foreign troops' withdrawal from the country.
The statement says that all Taliban fighters have been instructed to stop all kinds of offensive operations across the country from the first to the third day of Eid-ul-Fitr.
The statement added that Taliban fighters have been told that if they are attacked “by the enemy” during these three days, they should protect and defend themselves.
The fighters have also been asked to avoid any attempt to enter territories under the Afghan government’s control and also they should not allow any members of Afghan forces to enter their territories.
This comes as violence has been on the rise since the start of this month.

UN Security Council Condemns Kabul’s Deadly School Attack
","
The members of the Security Council condemned in “the strongest terms the atrocious and cowardly terrorist attack that took place in Kabul, Afghanistan, on 8 May 2021,” the UN said in a statement on Monday night.
The attack, which took place at Sayed-ul-Shuhada High School in the Dasht-e-Barchi area in Kabul’s District 13, resulted in the deaths of more than 60 people, many of whom were girls. More than 150 civilians were wounded.
“The members of the Security Council expressed their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the Government of Afghanistan and they wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured,” the council said in a statement.
The members of the Security Council expressed their deep concern about the continuing high level of violence and the security situation in Afghanistan, especially the number of civilian casualties, and stressed the importance of sustained efforts to end violence and protect civilians, it said.
“The Security Council reaffirms the right to education and its contribution to the achievement of peace and security and expresses grave concern about the significant number of attacks on schools and education facilities in Afghanistan in recent months, as well as the significant implications of such attacks on the safety of students and their ability to enjoy their right to education,” according to the statement.
The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that “terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.”
The members of the Security Council underlined the need to hold “perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice.”
“They urged all States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, to cooperate actively with the Government of Afghanistan and all other relevant authorities in this regard,” the statement said.
The members of the Security Council reiterated that “any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed. They reaffirmed the need for all States to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and other obligations under international law, including international human rights law, international refugee law and international humanitarian law, threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts.”

Saleh on CBS Says US 'Legitimized' Taliban, Must 'Remain Engaged'
","
Afghanistan's First Vice President Amrullah Saleh in an interview told CBS News said it was the American government that ""legitimized"" the Taliban in the first place, and now Afghans ""need the United States to remain engaged,"" even if it's not in the same form as the last 20 years.  
“The United States legitimized them. The Doha office is a creation of the United States. Getting Mullah Baradar out of the jail is an invention of the United States. Allowing them to travel here and there is with the help of the United States. Of course, Doha agreement is between the United States and the Taliban. They should be held accountable,” Saleh said. 
“At the end of the day, United States is a superpower, unless it says I'm not. It's a superpower, and they have leverage--all over. We respect that leverage because, as a needy country, we need the United States to remain engaged-- engaged diplomatically, economically, strategically. You know, as I said, what you see as a change in Afghanistan is largely, largely due to investment of the United States here,” he said. 
On the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, Saleh told CBS: “They have taken a decision, and we respect that decision. I'm sure they have calculated the risks. But if you ask me to remind them what is the risk, Taliban are terrorists.” 
The US military planners are looking for options to base forces and equipment in Central Asia and the Middle East after American and allied troops leave Afghanistan in the coming months, The Wall Street Journal reported.  
The report said that the US military commanders want bases for troops, drones, bombers and artillery to shore up the Afghan government, keep the Taliban insurgency in check and monitor other extremists. 
Options being assessed range from nearby countries to more distant Arab Gulf emirates and navy ships at sea, US government and military officials told The Wall Street Journal. 
According to some military and Biden administration officials, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan would be preferable, because they border Afghanistan and would allow for quick access. But Russia and China's influence in the area and tensions between them and Washington complicate plans for Central Asian bases, the officials said. 
“The drive to work looks like it will be a little bit longer for now,” one official said. 
Last month, US President Joe Biden announced that American troops will leave Afghanistan by September 11. NATO will also exit troops from the country by the same deadline.

Cemeteries in Western Kabul Extend after Each Deadly Attack
","
Western Kabul has many hills that have been changed into cemeteries. Now, these cemeteries must expand after each deadly bombing in that part of Kabul.  
At least 70 victims from the school bombing were laid to rest in these cemeteries – in one case 20 bodies in a row.  
Residents of western Kabul said victims of suicide bombings and blasts have been buried in these cemetaries in the hundreds over the last five years.
The victims’ families said they are tired of the mass burial of civilians, especially youth. 
“They are almost full. Victims of suicide bombings and explosions are brought here,” said Hassan, a grave digger. 
The victims of the Imam Zaman Mosque attack, the attack on the Mawood tuition center, the attack on the Dasht-e-Barchi 100-bed hospital, the attack on the Kawsar tuition center, and the attack on the Sayed-ul-Shuhada school were all buried in cemeteries in the west of Kabul, mostly on the hills. 
The victims of these attacks have included many youth, children and women. 
“If it is the NDS or police, it is their duty to ensure the safety of the people… This government is really insufficient,” said Abbas Adalat, a Kabul resident. 
“Such attacks should be prevented; otherwise, the voice of students will be silenced,” said Mohammad Husain, a Kabul resident. 
Families of the victims of the school bombing said that mostly students were killed in the attack. 
“My daughter was martyred and another was wounded. How long should this war continue? It is enough,” said Ali Reza, father of Masooma, a school student who was killed in Saturday’s bombing. 
“My father could not afford the needs for our training courses,” said Amina, a sister of a victim. 
First Vice President Amrullah Saleh on Tuesday said that 86 children were killed in the Kabul school bombing.

Afghanistan: 255 Civilians Killed During Ramadan
","
The Ministry of Interior Affairs said on Tuesday that 15 suicide attacks and dozens of other attacks have been carried out “by the Taliban” since the start of Ramadan on April 13. 
The ministry said that 500 more civilians were wounded in the attacks during this period. 
The Interior Ministry said that the Taliban were responsible for 200 blasts and 15 suicide bombings during Ramadan. 
The Taliban has denied the government’s claims that the group has a big hand in civilian deaths. 
The first day of Ramadan on April 13 witnessed clashes between Afghan security forces and the Taliban, in which eight civilians were killed and 21 more were wounded. 
“I thank all security forces. They prevented over 800 incidents and arrested over 800 terrorists who will be trailed and law will be implemented,” President Ghani said on Tuesday. 
“An attempt was made to kill Halimi because he told the truth but there wasn’t any mosque in Pakistan to raise their voice to condemn this massacre… From this, you will know the depth of the incident and will know where the plot is,” Saleh said. 
Figures obtained by TOLOnews from sources show that civilian deaths increased by 20% during the last one month (April 13 to May 12) compared to a month before. 
Most of the civilian deaths were caused by a car bomb attack in Logar, car bomb attack in Farsi district in Herat, roadside bomb blast in Zabul and three explosions near Sayed-ul-Shuhada school in Kabul. 
“Civilian casualties were high during Ramadan and there was a need for ceasefire. We hope the ceasefire continues so that we can move towards the talks,” said Khan Agha Rezaee, head of the internal security committee of the parliament. 
But overall, the announcement of the three-day ceasefire has created some hope among the people who say that this should be converted to a permanent ceasefire.

UK Military Chief: No Reason for Taliban’s Jihad in Afghanistan
","
General Sir Nicholas Carter, Chief of General Staff of the United Kingdom, has said that the Taliban has no justification for their Jihad in Afghanistan now that foreign forces are leaving the country.
In an interview with TOLOnews, General Carter said that the Taliban are now fighting against the Afghan people, and they should avoid the war.
Meanwhile, the Afghan Presidential Palace has said that President Ashraf Ghani in a joint meeting with Gen. Carter and the Pakistani Army Chief Gen. Qamar Jawed Bajwa discussed bilateral relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Afghan peace process and ways to end the violence in the country.
“There is no reason for the Taliban ever to be talking about Jihad again, they are now waging war against the Afghans,” said General Carter, Chief of General Staff of the United Kingdom.
Asked if Pakistan is harboring the Taliban, Gen. Carter said: “The plain fact is Pakistan recognizes that it has the similar problem to Afghanistan in terms of terrorism. Indeed, General Bajwa often described it as a disease, and ultimately, that disease will really only be solved by Afghanistan and Pakistan working closely together to get after that disease.""
He added: ""I am pretty confident that they both understand the problem in the same way and they will get after the problem collectively as partners.”
Ambassador Alison Blake, the UK's envoy to Afghanistan, meanwhile said that the UK will continue its political engagement with Afghanistan and will cooperate with the Afghan National Security and Defense Forces (ANDSF).
“Security in the country is something where we very much support the ANDSF in the government, the responsibility to keep citizens safe in Afghanistan is with the government, so, but we give the assurances that we can and that’s why it's good that General Carter is here [to show] our support of the UK to the republic of Afghanistan, to our partners in the ANDSF and to the people of Afghanistan--whether that is through development, to the economic aid, humanitarian assistance or our political engagement and lobbying will continue,” said UK ambassador to Afghanistan Alison Blake.
Meanwhile, a number of political commentators have said the recent meetings between Pakistani and British military officials show that London is trying to facilitate a new security agreement between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
It is said that General Nicholas Carter has a long acquaintance with President Ashraf Ghani and his Pakistani counterpart General Bajwa.
General Nicholas Carter has also served in Afghanistan for several years while Ghani was serving as head of the security transition commission from foreign forces to the Afghan forces.
General Carter has so far facilitated several mediatory meetings between high level officials from Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Logar MPs Raise Alarm Over Deteriorating Security
","
Lawmakers from Logar province in Afghanistan’s parliament on Tuesday raised grave concerns over what they described as deteriorating security in the province.
MPs warned that the fragile security situation in Logar could have serious implications on the security of Kabul if substantial actions weren’t taken to fix the lack of security in Logar.
However, the Ministry of Interior (MoI) has said that the Afghan security forces are fully prepared to address the security threats in neighboring provinces of Kabul.
Concerns over security threats in Logar come weeks after the province sustained a series of targeted killings of civilians and military personnel in the area.
At least ten people have been killed over the past two days in the provincial capital Pul-e-Alam and on the Kabul-Logar highway.
“Over the past two days, the head of the economic department, a bank manager and two other our powerful military personnel and six members of the National Directorate of Security were killed, the situation is deteriorating day by day,” said Haseebullah Stanekzai, the head of the Logar provincial council.
“No one is there to respond, no one is there to inquire about our plights, what are our faults,” said a resident in Logar, Mir Afghan.
“Three people were wounded yesterday, one was martyred, no one is there to respond,” said Haji Mirza, a resident in Logar.
Meanwhile, a number of residents in Logar have said that weakness and poor leadership of the local administration have been among the key factors that have led to the worsening security situation in the province.
“The situation in Logar has worsened, local officials have failed to secure even Pul-e-Alam city, the center of Logar province,” said Mohammad Akbar Stanekzai, the deputy head of senate.
“The security and defense forces of the country are fully ready to maintain security in Kabul and in the neighboring provinces,” said Tariq Arian, a spokesman for the Ministry of Interior.
In the northern province of Badakhshan, at least ten members of the public uprising forces were killed in a Taliban attack in Jurm district.
In Parwan province, at least four people--among them a local government employee--were killed in attacks by unidentified gunmen.
“We had six casualties among the public uprising forces, 4 injuries were also reported,” said MP Zia Yaftali.

Pakistan Not to Host US Bases for Afghan Mission: VOA
","
Pakistan ruled out Tuesday the possibility of again providing its military bases to the United States for future counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan, as US troops prepare to completely leave the country by September 11, VOA reported. 
Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi made the remarks to reporters in Islamabad, explaining that his government has adopted a policy that allows it to be ""only partners in peace,"" and not involved in any future US war. 
“No sir, we do not intend to allow boots on the ground and no [US] bases are being transferred to Pakistan,” Qureshi said when asked whether his government is under pressure to give military bases to the US. 
The report said that US President Joe Biden’s administration has acknowledged it is in talks with several Central Asian neighbors of Afghanistan to examine where it can reposition troops to prevent the landlocked country from once again becoming a terrorist base for groups like al-Qaida. 
But US officials have not named Pakistan, nor have they commented on media speculation that the subject of bases might be under bilateral discussions.   
Qureshi said “we feel” the Taliban’s engagement in the Afghan peace process would bring and enhance the “international respectability and recognition” that the group required. 
“If they want to be acceptable, if they want delisting to take place, if they want recognition then engagement, giving up violence and looking for a political solution is in their political interest,” he said. 
In the meantime, the US forces in Afghanistan have handed over one facility to the Afghan National Army and transferred more than 1,800 pieces of equipment to be destroyed since the American drawdown from the country began May 1, US Central Command said Tuesday, according to a report published by Stars and Stripes.  
CENTCOM’s estimate of completion is an “aggregate percentage of progress across all the different lines of effort that go into retrograde,” including equipment, personnel and facilities, chief Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters at the Pentagon. 
The US withdrawal from Afghanistan, which President Joe Biden ordered to be completed by Sept. 11, was about 6-12% complete as of Monday, according to the statement. 
“Since the president's decision, the US has retrograded the equivalent of approximately 104 [military transport aircraft] C-17 [Globemaster III] loads of material out of Afghanistan,” CENTCOM said. 
Kirby said CENTCOM did not release the number of troops that remain in Afghanistan because it would provide “a level of situational awareness for the Taliban,” which Pentagon officials have warned could attack withdrawing US forces. 
“We have an obligation to keep our people safe, particularly in a retrograde that could be opposed,” he said. “We need to be careful about the kind of information that's in the public space.” 
Before the drawdown began, there were about 2,500 US troops in Afghanistan. However, the Pentagon deployed several hundred Army Rangers and 12 F-18 attack planes to Afghanistan last week to assist with the drawdown, The Associated Press reported Thursday.

Ceasefire in Afghanistan to Start Wednesday at Midnight
","
A three-day nationwide ceasefire between the Afghan government and the Taliban is expected to begin on midnight Wednesday.
The Taliban’s spokesman told TOLOnews that the ceasefire is not to continue after the three days of Eid-ul-Fitr, which begins on Thursday.
However, the public has urged the Taliban to agree to a permanent ceasefire and stop their violence against the Afghan government forces after Eid.
Farid Ahmad serves in the ranks of the Afghan National Police (ANP) and has in recent months been busy fighting the Taliban in the outskirts of Kunduz province. But the reciprocal ceasefire between the Afghan govt and the Taliban has provided a chance for the embattled soldiers to breathe and enjoy the calm for a few days.
“We are happy if the ceasefire is extended, but we are fully prepared to defend and will fight against the enemies until our last drop of our blood,” said Farid Ahmad, an Afghan National Police soldier in Kunduz.
“I don’t think that this ceasefire will be extended as it is not based on an agreement,” said Sayed Akbar Agha, a former Taliban commander.
“Increased violence creates mistrust and hatred among the Afghan people about the peace process,” said Fawzia Koofi, a member of the peace negotiating team representing the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in the talks with the Taliban.
On Monday, the Taliban instructed its fighters to observe a three-day ceasefire during Eid.
Later on, President Ashraf Ghani in a statement also instructed all Afghan forces to observe the ceasefire during the three days of Eid, but he reiterated that the Taliban’s violence has no legitimacy as international troops are leaving the country.
Previously, the US Department of State, the Afghan government, the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission and the UN mission in Afghanistan have called on the Taliban to extend the ceasefire.
This is the third time that the Taliban has agreed to a ceasefire during the three days of Eid.

'Tactical Retreat' Preceded Fall of Nerkh District: Officials
","
 Following reports about the fall of Nerkh district of Maidan Wardak province to the Taliban, Afghan security officials said that the security forces made a ""tactical retreat"" from the district.
Maidan Wardak's governor said that the security forces retreated from the district as part of a ""conspiracy,"" without further elaborating. He said the district is currently under Taliban control.
However, the Afghan Ministry of Defense (MoD) has rejected any kind of ""conspiracy"" and said that reinforcements have been sent to recapture the district from the Taliban.
“Regrettably, the Taliban took over the district last night because of a conspiracy, the security forces then made a tactical retreat, the district building has sustained damages,” said Abdul Rahman Tariq, the governor of Maidan Wardak.
The Taliban meanwhile released footage and claimed that their fighters have taken Nerkh from the government forces.
The Taliban also claimed to have killed many soldiers and taken dozens more hostage.
“Unfortunately, the situation is not stable even in the city, if this situation continues we will face a tragedy,” said MP Abdul Rahman Wardak.
Nerkh district is only 30 kilometers away from Kabul.
“If the security forces do not capture the district, Sayedabad district will also face serious threats,” said Amir Mohammad Malikzai, the district governor of Sayedabad.
""The landmines planted along the way by the enemy and their use of civilian's homes slowed our operations,” said Rohullah Ahmadzai, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.
“(Losing) a district is a big issue, even if a check post falls for a day, then we will have a very serious situation in the next two or three months and it will be very difficult to compensate it,” said MP Karim Atal.
Meanwhile, Mullah Mannan Niazi, the deputy leader of a splinter group of the Taliban led by Mullah Rasul, was wounded in a clash in western Herat province on Tuesday evening, sources said. 
“Last night Mullah Abdul Manan Niazi was hit by three bullets in the head during a battle, three of his colleagues were killed,” said Herat governor Sayed Wahid Qatali.
Local officials have not commented on the report.
The clash occurred around 10 pm local time in Guzara district in Herat after several attackers targeted the area where he lived, the sources said, adding that “he got injuries on his head and is under treatment at Herat’s regional hospital.”
Over the past two weeks, violence has significantly increased in Herat, Farah, Badghis, Helmand, Kandahar, Zabul, Logar, Balkh, Kunduz, Baghlan and Maidan Wardak provinces.
The Ministry of Interior Affairs said on Tuesday that 15 suicide attacks and dozens of other attacks have been carried out “by the Taliban” since the start of Ramadan on April 13.
The ministry said that 500 more civilians were wounded in the attacks during this period.
The Interior Ministry said that the Taliban were responsible for 200 blasts and 15 suicide bombings during Ramadan.
The Taliban has denied the government’s claims that the group has a big hand in civilian deaths.
The first day of Ramadan on April 13 witnessed clashes between Afghan security forces and the Taliban, in which eight civilians were killed and 21 more were wounded.

Taliban Should Take Opportunity for Peace: Ghani
","
President Ashraf Ghani on Thursday, after Eid prayers at the Presidential Place, called on the Taliban to use the opportunity for peace created by the foreign troops leaving the country. 
The prayer ceremony was attended by former president Hamid Karzai, Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, the Parliament speaker Mir Rahman Rahmani, Senate speaker Fazl Hadi Muslimyar and a number of other politicians and government officials.
“The Taliban cannot have a better chance than this as the international troops are leaving the country,” Ghani said, adding that “the people's arms are open to them” and end the war.  
“Our people know who is responsible for blasts and suicide attacks,” Ghani said. “We don’t want destruction, we want development.”  
“The international troops' withdrawal from Afghanistan is a great opportunity,” he said. “The new chapter of our cooperation with the international community has started.” 
“Today, the region looks at Afghanistan as an opportunity,” he said. 
“There is political consensus in the country, and the Republic is an umbrella for all,” Ghani said.  
“Let's see the Taliban's intention,” he said, referring to the peace efforts. “All the politicians want an Afghan-owned and Afghan-led peace process.”  
“What is your (Taliban) message, what do you want, why are you destroying the districts?” Ghani said. Show us one district where you have complete control and have built something.”  
He mentioned that the Taliban’s war has costed the nation $1billion. 
He also said that Pakistan's Army Chief Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa on his visit to Kabul “clearly said that they don’t want an Islamic Emirate” and announced their support to the Republic.  
“Soon you will witness a regional consensus on the Afghan peace process,"" he said, adding that regional support for Afghanistan is increasing. 
""Afghanistan’s peace and stability means peace and stability in the region,” he said. 
In reaction to Taliban leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada’s Eid message, Ghani asked him to study the country's history ""before issuing messages and asking the people to surrender.”  
President Ghani warned of a third wave of COVID-19 and called on the people to follow the health guidance of the Ministry of Public Health during Eid days.  
“The new wave of COVID-19 has started and is spreading. We had a meeting to manage this situation,” Ghani said.  
On Wednesday, the Ministry of Public Health reported 370 new positive cases of COVID-19 out of 908 samples tested in the last 24 hours.   
The ministry also reported 12 deaths and 67 recoveries from COVID-19 in the same period.

Herat Soldiers, Residents Call for Extension of 3-Day Ceasefire
","
A number of Afghan security and defense forces in Herat, who have spent months on the battlefield and are away from their families, welcome the three-day ceasefire between the Taliban and the government. 
They say it is better for all parties to declare a permanent ceasefire and to resolve their disagreements through negotiations.  
Residents also expressed their wish that the Taliban and the government would not limit the ceasefire to Eid al-Fitr.
Nizamuddin is an army soldier in Herat. He has just returned from fighting elsewhere, and is ensuring the security of Eid days at an outpost. He hopes the 3-day ceasefire between the Taliban and the government becomes a permanent ceasefire. 


 



""It is a pleasure that a 3-day ceasefire is announced by both of the warring parties. We all deserve to have a permanent ceasefire, but the 3-day ceasefire is also good."" 
Nizamuddin is originally from Badakhshan province and he has been fighting in the most insecure provinces in the western parts of the country for the past five months. 
""I have not been on leave for five months and have worked in various divisions in Badghis and Farah provinces, as well as in Shindand district."" 
Sayed Mohammad, another soldier in Herat, said: ""I am very relaxed today as we are having three peaceful days during the Eid festival and I pray to God that there will be an inclusive peace in Afghanistan soon."" 
Residents of Herat celebrated the first day of Eid in peace.


 



Worshipers at Masjid Jamea (Herat’s most famous mosque), after Eid prayers, welcomed a three-day ceasefire between the government and the Taliban but they called for both parties in the conflict to extend the 3-day ceasefire, and ensure a permanent one. 
“We want this ceasefire to stand forever. Previously, the Taliban said they were fighting and launching suicide attacks against Americans, but now, as foreign forces are leaving the country, why should we Afghans kill each other?” said one of Herat’s residents, Abdullah Attayei.
“We call on the leaders of the country to solve the current problems so there would be no more fratricide and destruction in the country,” said Serajuddin Morami, resident of Herat province. 
A large number of Afghan citizens believe that the calm during the 3-day ceasefire is like the calm before a storm.  
These citizens are worried that upon completion of the 3-day ceasefire, fighting, and violence in the country will once again surge and will claim the lives of many innocent Afghans.

9 Killed in Kandahar, Kunduz on 1st Day of Ceasefire
","
On the first day of Eid-al-Fitr, at the beginning of a 3-day ceasefire between the Taliban and Afghan forces, explosions in Kandahar and Kunduz provinces killed nine people and injured 17.
Two landmines exploded in Kandahar province--one in Panjwai and the other in Maiwand district--killing seven civilians and wounding three others.
A landmine blast, remote-controlled, in the town of Sardawra in the northern province of Kunduz, killed two people, including a child, and injured 14 others, most of them children.
The blast in the city of Kunduz occurred just hours after the Eid prayers.
A Kunduz resident said: “The security forces arrived in the area 40 minutes after the accident occurred, while the Kunduz police headquarters is only 100 meters away from the incident area.”
“A Muslim does never oppress another Muslim in this way. We grow our children in poverty and miserable conditions, but they become victims very easily. If they (perpetrators) are Muslims, they should never commit such an atrocity against children,” said another resident of Kunduz province.
Officials in the Kunduz Provincial Hospital said the injured patients are in a critical state.
“Unfortunately, 16 people, who were injured and martyred in the explosion, were taken to the hospital,” said Fahim Hussainzada, a physician in Kundoz’s provincial hospital.
Meanwhile, in Kandahar province, two roadside mines exploded in Panjwai and Maiwand districts, killing seven civilians and wounding three others.
“At 9:30 a.m. today a landmine exploded on a taxi, carrying civilians, in Panjwai district. The mine was placed by the Taliban,” said Jamal Barakzai, spokesman for the Kandahar police chief.
In the past week, and before the government and the Taliban declared a 3-day ceasefire on Eid al-Fitr, more than a dozen provinces were witnessing heavy clashes between the fighters from the two sides.
Kabul, Kandahar, Helmand, Herat, and Balkh are the provinces that were least secure in the past week.

Dostum Calls for Taliban to End Violence, Focus on Peace
","
Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum, former vice president and head of the Islamic National Movement of Afghanistan--Junbish-e-Milli--in an address to a gathering in his home province of Jawzjan on Thursday, said the Taliban must stop violence and should bow to the people’s demand for a lasting ceasefire.
“We are Muslims. We should not fight against each other. If we want to fight, we should fight united against those countries that have an eye on our soil,” Dostum said.
In Balkh province, meanwhile, Atta Mohammad Noor, the head of the splinter faction of the Jamiat-e-Islami party, in an address to the residents of the northern province made a similar statement to the Taliban and warned the group that “it would be suppressed” if the opportunity for peace was lost.
“If a real mobilization was made, I am saying here among thousands of people that I promise to take over 50% of areas controlled by Taliban in a blink if there is war-- but I pray that there is no more war,” Noor said.
But another former mujahedeen leader, Juma Khan Hamdard, who is head of the council of the Hizb-e-Islami party, said differences among the country’s political leaders and the “monopolization” of peace affairs by the Presidential Palace have prolonged the stalled peace negotiations with the Taliban.
“The peace negotiations have stalled for the last six months. It is delayed from one day to another day. We have many plans (for peace). We would have achieved peace in two months if we came together around the government and if we had a unified plan,” Hamdard said.
This comes as the US and coalition forces have begun withdrawing from Afghanistan and a much-expected conference on Afghanistan in Turkey has been delayed multiple times over non-participation by the Taliban. Meanwhile, violence has also remained high in the country, especially during Ramadan – April 13 to May 13 – during which the Ministry of Interior Affairs said that more than 250 civilians were killed in Taliban violence across the country.

Foreign Troops Pullout 'Irresponsible' Amid Violence: Hekmatyar
","
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of Hizb-e-Islami, called the decision to withdraw foreign troops from Afghanistan ""irresponsible"" as violence escalates, and he warned of another war beginning.
Hekmatyar said that the decision to withdraw foreign troops from Afghanistan was “wrong” ahead of forming of a transitional government. 
“With the withdrawal of the foreign troops it’s clear that another war will begin in the country unless Afghans reach an agreement over a transitional government--as the war, bombings have already increased,” he said.
He also said that there is no reason for the war in Afghanistan, as the foreign troops are withdrawing from the country. 
“There is change in the position and words of the government ... We are also expecting the Taliban think about the situation, and with the withdrawal of the foreign troops, the reason and justification for war is ending,” he said. 
He also wants the preservation of all the structures of the current system, especially the security forces. 
“The system must remain as it is and only the officials must change,” he said, adding: “The security forces and its formation must remain as it is.""
In the meantime, Afghan citizens say that as foreign troops withdraw from Afghanistan, the warring parties must stop the violence. 
“We say yes to peace so the Prophet and God will be pleased with us” said Mohammad Musa Noori, a religious scholar.
Abdul Basir, a resident of Kabul said: “They (government and Taliban) should reach a peace that is for the good of Afghans.”

US to Tackle Terrorism Threats in Afghanistan after Withdrawal
","
The Pentagon has said that the United States will address the issue of threats emancipating from terrorism in Afghanistan even after the withdrawal of American forces from the country.
David Helvey, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs, told members of US Congress Committee on Armed Services that the United States was assessing ways to combat terrorist groups in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of the US and coalition forces.
“As part of the inter-agency review of the United States’ policy in Afghanistan, the administration assesses that threat from violent extremist organizations against the United States now emanating from Afghanistan can be addressed without a persistent United States’ military presence in that country,” Helvey said.
“At the same time, we work closely with the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces and with our allies and partners to maintain counterterrorism capabilities in the region sufficient to ensure that Afghanistan cannot again become a safe haven for terrorists,” he added.
But a member of the US House of Representatives said that the Taliban will fight until they take the power by force.
“Since May 1st, Taliban has been crystal clear about their intentions. They have launched a new offensive targeting coalition forces, Afghan soldiers and innocent civilians. On Saturday, the Taliban bombed a girls school in Kabul, killing over 50 people, most of them young girls. Make no mistake, they will fight until they control that country again,” said Mike Rogers, a member of the US House of Representatives.  
Meanwhile, The New York Times has reported that western spy agencies are evaluating and courting regional leaders outside the Afghan government who might be able to provide intelligence about terrorist threats long after US forces withdraw, according to current and former American, European and Afghan officials.
Ahmad Massoud, the son of Afghanistan’s National Hero Ahmad Shah Massoud, is one of the names in the report among new allies for US in the country after the troops withdrawal.
“Among the candidates being considered today for intelligence gathering is the son of Ahmad Shah Massoud, the famed Afghan fighter who led fighters against the Soviets in the 1980s and then against the Taliban as head of the Northern Alliance the following decade. The son — Ahmad Massoud, 32 — has spent the last few years trying to revive the work of his father by assembling a coalition of militias to defend Afghanistan’s north,” wrote the report.
Based on the report, top CIA officials, including William J. Burns, the agency’s director, have acknowledged that they are looking for new ways to collect information in Afghanistan once American forces are withdrawn, and their ability to gather information on terrorist activity is diminished.
Washington is more divided, and some government analysts do not think Massoud would be able to build an effective coalition.
But in the New York Times report it was writthen whether the new allies were aimed to fight the Taliban in the future.

Ghani Seeks Powerful Consensus on Peace as He Meets Politicians
","
In a series of his recent meetings with influential political leaders, President Ashraf Ghani on Friday met with former president Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the High Council of National Reconciliation, as part of efforts to develop national and political consensus around peace.
The country’s political situation, the peace process, strengthening of political consensus and ensuring a just and lasting peace in the country were discussed in the meeting, the Presidential Palace said.
Sources told TOLOnews that the Presidential Palace believes that the creation of the High Council of Government helps to increase meetings and consultations among the country’s political leaders for better management of the peace process after the withdrawal of foreign forces from the country.
“So far, decision has not been made on the name and the authorities of the council,” said Dawa Khan Menapal, a presidential spokesman.
Based on the political agreement signed between Ghani and Abdullah as a result of election deadlock last year, the creation of the High Council of Government was aimed to develop and take major decisions about national issues of the coutnry, however, the president wants the council to have an advisory role rather than a decision-making one.
“Dr. Ashraf Ghani ignores all the recommendations that are raised for reforms, otherwise, the establishment of high council of government leaders where there are presence of influential personalities of Afghanistan for major decision makings on national issues. This also helps to avoid dependence on other local institutions,” said political analyst Abdul Hafiz Mansour.
Sources have said that the council will be comprised of 25 powerful political leaders of Afghanistan.
Sources said that Ghani has reported suggested Fazel Fazly as head of the secretariat of the council. Fazly currently serves as the head of Administrative Office of the President.
“The situation is critical and it could be worse. I want to address the president if he is willing to make a decision on behalf of the entire nation. He will be the winner of the ground,” said Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum, former vice president.

He said the blast was followed by a gunfight between “army forces and Taliban.”
“These violations have happened in several areas by groups that operate under Taliban command because they do not obey their leader in action and this indicates Taliban’s weakness,” Defense Ministry spokesman Rohullah Ahmadzai said.

Ghani Seeks European Allies’ Role to ‘Get Pakistan On Board’
","
As US and coalition forces are withdrawing from the country and the peace talks have stalled amidst a sharp increase in violence, President Ashraf Ghani has emphasized the need for a decision on peace by the region and for Europe’s further role to ""get Pakistan on board.""
Quoted in an interview by Der Spiegel on Friday, President Ghani said Europeans, especially Germany, “can do a lot” in the peace process with the Taliban.
He said that Pakistan as a state has to make an important decision on Afghan peace.
“Clear messages and incentives from Germany will help – and, conversely, they should introduce sanctions if the decision goes in a different direction than hoped,” Ghani said. “As Europeans, you should not see yourself as observers; you are a direct part of these events.”
Asks if a future security agreement between Afghanistan and Pakistan is the key to peace, Ghani said that it is “most certainly an important key” but added that his “goal is the neutrality of Afghanistan.”
“We don't want a new protecting power, and we don't want to be part of regional or international rivalries,” Ghani said as quoted in the interview.
He said peace will primarily be decided upon regionally and that “we are at a crucial moment of rethinking.”
“It is first and foremost a matter of getting Pakistan on board,” Ghani said in the interview. “The US now plays only a minor role. The question of peace or hostility is now in Pakistani hands.”
In response to a question about the influence of the Pakistani government on the Taliban, Ghani said Pakistan operates an organized system of support. 
He said that “the Taliban receive logistics” in Pakistan, “their finances are there, and recruitment is there.” 
He added: “The names of the various decision-making bodies of the Taliban are Quetta Shura, Miramshah Shura and Peshawar Shura – named after the Pakistani cities where they are located. There is a deep relationship with the state.”
His remarks came a day after his meeting with Pakistan army chief Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa. 
Ghani said that in their meeting, Bajwa clearly assured him “that the restoration of the Emirate or dictatorship by the Taliban is not in anybody’s interest in the region, especially Pakistan.” 
But Ghani said that Bajwa told him that “some of the lower levels in the [Pakistani] army still hold the opposite opinion in certain cases.”
President Ghani said that in any case, “Western diplomacy should stop coddling” the Taliban. 
He said that the Taliban made the environment for recent attacks, including the attack on Kabul school, and that the group has not cut its ties with al-Qaida.
About his efforts to build consensus around peace and to form a state council, Ghani said he is making his utmost efforts to form the country and that the peace process is a fundamental scenario.
“Once the Taliban realize that they cannot overthrow the government, they will need to come to peace as the dominant scenario,” he added.
Ghani expressed his concerns about the possibility of a civil war in the country as a result of the full withdrawal of foreign troops from the country but reiterated that “it doesn’t have to come to that.”
Ghani on Friday met Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the High Council of National Reconciliation, and former president Hamid Karzai as part of efforts to develop national and political consensus around peace.
The country’s political situation, the peace process, strengthening of political consensus and ensuring a just and lasting peace in the country were discussed in the meeting, the Presidential Palace said.
Sources said the Presidential Palace believes that the creation of the state council will help to increase meetings and consultations among the country’s political leaders for better management of the peace process after the withdrawal of foreign forces from the country.

Afghans Call for Peace as Eid Ceasefire Nears to End
","
Afghans across the country on Saturday said that despite some incidents of violence, the majority of the people managed to celebrate Eid in relative calm in the last three days due to reciprocal ceasefire between the Taliban and the Afghan government.
Many of the youths during these days flocked to the picnic points to spend their time together with friends and families.
Videos on social media show that some people in Taliban-influenced areas also flocked to picnic sites to spend their time in a peaceful environment.
“People are happy. We are tired of explosions and suicide attacks,” said Tamim, a Kabul resident.
“We spend the three days of Eid in a happy way, we want peace, we want an end to war,” said a resident in Kabul Ahmad Fawad.
“Three days of ceasefire will not heal our pain. There should be a permanent ceasefire and peace,” said Juma Khan, a resident of Kabul.
The Defense Ministry said the Taliban has violated the ceasefire in at least 10 provinces in the last three days.
Rohullah Ahmadzai, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, said that at least 40 people were killed and wounded in scattered Taliban attacks in various regions of the country.
Taliban has denied the allegations as baseless.

Ceasefire to End at Midnight amid Reports of Scattered Violence
","
A three-day Eid ceasefire between the Afghan government and the Taliban is coming to an end at midnight on Saturday amid reports of heavy fighting between the Afghan security forces and the Taliban in some parts of the country.
Political leaders said that Taliban attacks during the Eid truce are raising serious questions on the modality of the government’s peace-oriented policy with the group.
“It will be good news if there is a permanent ceasefire in the country. All barriers in the way of ceasefire should be removed and people should be given the power,” said Sayed Akbar Agha, a former Taliban commander.
“The incidents that happened raises the question that who did all these? We have said this in the past that there are several militant groups here and the government needs to tackle them all,” said Sayed Ishaq Gailani, chairman of the National Solidarity Movement of Afghanistan.
The Afghan government has been insisting that the Taliban should agree on a permanent truce as it makes the fundamental aspiration of the Afghan people.
“Permanent ceasefire is the fundamental demand of the Afghan people and the government,” said Dawa Khan Menapal, head of the Government’s Media and Information Center. “The Taliban’s war does not have legitimacy.”
“We are fully prepared to defend the Afghan people within the framework of a comprehensive working plan and foil any possible attack and evil planning of the enemies after the ceasefire,” said Rohullah Ahmadzai, spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.
This comes weeks after several attacks rocked Afghanistan including last week’s car bombing in front of Sayed Al-Shuhada school in the west of Kabul that killed over 80 students and wounded 150 more and a recent attack on a guest house packed with students in Logar.
The Afghan government blames the Taliban for both attacks. But the Taliban has denied any involvement.
On Friday, a heavy explosion happened at a mosque in Shakar Dara district north of Kabul in which 12 civilians, including the imam of the mosque, were killed and at least 15 more were wounded.
The Ministry of Defense (MoD) said Saturday that at least 40 people were killed and wounded in separate Taliban attacks in nearly 10 provinces despite a previous commitment by the group to halt fighting during the three days of Eid ceasefire.
Taliban has rejected the allegations and has blamed the government for not honoring its ceasefire commitments.
According to the data gathered by TOLOnews, Baghlan, Faryab, Takhar, Badakhshan, Kunduz, Balkh, Logar, Kapisa, Farah, Herat, Laghman, Maidan Wardak, Kapisa, Uruzgan and Helmand witnessed fighting between the government forces and the Taliban.
In the latest incident of violence, one police force member and two civilians were wounded in an explosion in Sarubi district in Kabul on Saturday morning.

Taliban has rejected the allegations and has blamed the government for not honoring its ceasefire commitments. 
During the three days of Eid, violence reported in Kandahar, Ghazni, Kunduz, Herat, Farah, Uruzgan, Kapisa, Helmand and Maidan Wardak provinces.

Israel Strike in Gaza Destroys Building with AP, Al Jazeera
","
An Israeli airstrike targeted and destroyed a high-rise building in Gaza City that housed offices of The Associated Press, Al Jazeera and other media outlets hours after another Israeli air raid on a densely populated refugee camp killed at least 10 Palestinians from an extended family, mostly children, on Saturday.
The strike on the high-rise came nearly an hour after the military ordered people to evacuate the 12-story building, the Associated Press reported.
According to the report, the strike brought down the entire structure, which collapsed in a gigantic cloud of dust. There was no immediate explanation for why it was attacked.
The earlier Israeli airstrike on the Gaza City refugee camp was the deadliest single strike of the current conflict between Israel and the militant group Hamas. Both sides are pressing for an advantage as cease-fire efforts gather strength.
The violence started in Jerusalem and spread across the region over the past week, with Jewish-Arab clashes and rioting in mixed cities of Israel. 
There were also widespread Palestinian protests Friday in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli forces shot and killed 11 people, according to Associated Press.

Families Seek Probe, Security After Kabul School Attack
","
Families of the victims of the deadly blasts on May 8 near Sayed al-Shuhada school in the west of Kabul that killed over 80 people--all students--said the incident requires an extensive probe by the United Nations and called for a proper security plan for students in that part of the city. Students have been attacked in that area at least three times recently.
The families appeared at a press conference in Kabul on Sunday where they called for proper attention to be paid to those affected by the incident.
The families put the casualties at 90 killed and over 240 wounded, all students.
“We call on the international community, the UN, human rights defender organizations to probe the cruel attack and find the perpetrators through a probe team so that the Hazara community, especially girls, are not deprived of their right to live and be educated,” said Masooma, a member of an affected family.
Other members of the victims’ families said the government should address the plight of those wounded in the attack.
“We don’t have any demand from the government except to ensure our security,” said Rajab Ali, father of a victim.
“The government has made many promises, but it has not practiced them,” said Mina Nazari, sister of a victim.
Meanwhile, the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission said the government should not delay the probe into the attack on Sayed al-Shuhada school.
“There is a need for a practical step. If not, or if they cannot, they can seek help from the international court so that it can assess cases of war crimes,” said Zabihullah Farhang, head of the media office of the commission.
Following the attack, President Ghani directed his two vice presidents to probe the incident and make a security plan to boost the security in the west of Kabul.
The Second Vice President Sarwar Danesh’s office said that the security plan will be finalized within the next few days.
“A technical study was done about the population in the west of Kabul and the existing capacity in our security agencies in that area. An inclusive plan will be made based on these discussions and studies, and will be submitted to the Presidential Palace in the coming days,” said Hadi Mohammad Hedayat, an adviser to the second vice president.
The attack happened on May 8. It was started with a car bomb attack near the school and was followed by two bomb blasts in that area.
Government figures show that at least 80 people were killed and 150 more were wounded in the attack.

Violence Reported in 15 Provinces as Ceasefire Ends
","
Shortly after the end of the three-day ceasefire, fighting escalated in at least 15 provinces since the early hours of Sunday.
The Defense Ministry said that the Taliban violated the ceasefire in 21 provinces and that 21 civilians were killed and 33 more were wounded in their attacks during the three days of Eid ( May 13 to 15).  
But the Taliban has denied violating the ceasefire.
Abdul Zahir Atal, the police chief of Dawlatshah district in Laghman, died of wounds sustained in a clash with the Taliban in the province on Sunday, a local official said. 
“Dawlatshah district has been faced with a tough security situation over the last seven months and there has been no attention to it,” said Mohammad Farooq Watanyar, a resident of Laghman. 
In Helmand, meanwhile, Afghan forces launched operations on the outskirts of Lashkargah city and Nahre Saraj district in which at least 20 Taliban were killed, the Defense Ministry said. 
“There are clashes in Nawa district. There were sporadic attacks on an outpost on the outskirts of Lashkargah city. Now, the fighting has escalated. We expected the ceasefire to continue,” said Ataullah Afghan, head of the Helmand provincial council. 
According to information provided by security agencies, 18 provinces witnessed ceasefire violations by the Taliban from May 13 to May 15. 
But a Taliban spokesman denied violating the ceasefire but said that some bombs that were placed before the ceasefire detonated and caused casualties. 
“The Taliban’s ‘terrorist’ activities continued during the three days of ceasefire in which 21 civilians were martyred and 33 more were wounded,” said Fawad Aman, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense. “Their terrorist activities continued after the ceasefire.”  
Kabul residents said there is a need for a greater focus on peace efforts and a permanent ceasefire in the country. 
“The negotiations will lead to a result if there is a continued ceasefire,” said Hassan Khan, a Kabul resident. 
“War is not the solution. People want to live in peace and stability,” said Jamil, a Kabul resident. 
Meanwhile, President Ghani has ordered military commanders to conduct operations against the Taliban if they continue violence operations
“Nothing has been achieved or will be achieved by violence. If they think that they will win militarily, they have calculated wrong. Afghan people will never surrender,” said Basir Osmani, an MP from Badghis.

Sources: Taliban Open to Istanbul Summit But Wants Talks in Doha
","
The Taliban has agreed to begin substantive talks with the Republic team in Doha in the coming days, according to sources close to the group, which would end the peace process stalemate. 
The sources said that the group plans to attend the Istanbul summit, but wants the end negotiations to take place in Doha. 
The negotiating teams met in Doha on May 14 after a long pause. Sources familiar with the meeting said the Taliban has asked to maintain the Doha negotiations--with serious discussions-- but they want the final outcome to be achieved in Doha, not in Istanbul. 
“I think that this will open the way for an Istanbul conference where the Taliban will attend. They might make the agenda based on who in the Afghan government team will attend, not based on the US agenda,” said Sayed Akbar Agha, a former Taliban commander. 
The Republic team said that efforts in Doha and Istanbul will help achieve results in the negotiations, but they stressed that the Taliban’s commitment is key. 
“A meeting will be meaningful when the attendees include decision-makers and when there is a commitment for decision making. Only participation of high-ranking leaders can affect the current Doha process,” said Fawzia Koofi, member of the negotiating team of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. 
Meanwhile, a delegation representing the Taliban led by Shai Abdul Hakim Haqqani has been in Pakistan over the last 20 days discussing with the leadership of the group the details of attending the Istanbul summit and the withdrawal of international troops from Afghanistan. 
“Pakistan’s influence on the Taliban and the possible encouragement from Pakistan of course has an impact,” said Mohammad Amin Waqad, former deputy head of the High Peace Council. 
The negotiations in Doha were stalled after the announcement of a delay in US forces withdrawal in Afghanistan from the original May 1st deadline.

Wounding of ANA Soldiers by Minister's Bodyguards Sparks Outcry
","
Several army soldiers were wounded in a clash with guards working for acting Interior Minister Hayatullah Hayat in Herat on Friday. The incident has sparked strong reactions. 
Local civilian and security officials in Herat confirmed that three army soldiers were wounded in an attack by Hayatullah Hayat's guards, and called the incident ""an insult to the law.""
According to the officials, the incident took place after an argument between Hayat's bodyguards and army soldiers at the guest house of the Minister of Industry and Trade in Herat.
The Ministry of Interior and local officials in Herat declined to officially provide details on the incident.
According to local sources in Herat, the incident took place on the second night of Eid at the guest house of Nisar Ahmad Ghoriani, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Allegedly, Hayat's bodyguards first argued with the army soldiers and then shot and beat them severely.
“The soldiers serve the people all day and night so they can live in peace. If you are the right minister, come and fight on the front line,” said a Herat resident, Shams Rahman Ahmadzai.
“A soldier who has always been on the front lines of the war should not be beaten in the city. We did not expect such an action,” said Mohammad Yousuf, another resident of Herat.
While officials did not provide details on the incident, a reliable source on condition of anonymity told TOLOnews that three army soldiers were seriously wounded from gunfire by Hayatullah Hayat's bodyguards.
Toryalai Taheri, the deputy head of Badghis provincial council, said: “The action of the minister's bodyguards against ANA soldiers was unfair. The minister should not have ordered his bodyguards to act in such a fierce way and beat the soldiers.”
Military experts called the attack by the guards of the acting Minister of Interior ""shameful,"" and said that the perpetrators of such violent acts should be brought to justice.
“Those who are non-professional, non-military and are not familiar with military and ethical codes are being assigned to high-rank positions, and they constantly violate the laws,” a military expert, Mohammad Nayeem Ghayur, said.
TOLOnews tried to reach the Ministry of Interior for further information about the incident, but the ministry refused to provide details.
This incident comes as the acting Interior Minister has been investigating the security situation in the western parts of the country for the last three days.

Protests to Continue Over Faryab Governor Appointment
","
The National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan, or Junbish-e-Islami, led by former vice president Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum, has threatened to continue their protests over the new governor’s appointment in Faryab until the Afghan government listens to their demands. 
The protestors held a large rally in Faryab and prevented a helicopter carrying Mohammad Daud Laghmani, the new governor for Faryab, from landing in the city of Maimana where he was expected to assume office on Saturday. 
“The protests will continue until the demands of the people are met,” Junbish spokesman Ehsan Nairo said. 
“The government must address people’s concerns that are raised through protests over decisions that are based on law,” said Wahid Farzaee, a lawyer. 
Some politicians said that the government should not influence the situation by such provocative moves, as the country is already in a critical political condition. 
Faryab has turned into an insecure province over the last 23 days, and is now faced with a new problem: opposition against the government’s decision to appoint a new governor for the northern province. 
“The government should make efforts to prevent rifts and ethnic and language-based provocations,” said Sayed Hassan Sharifi Balkhabi, an MP from Sar-e-Pul. 
Faryab residents also said that they will continue their protest until their demand is accepted by the government. 
“The appointment of the governor by the Presidential Palace will lead to collapse of Faryab province,” said Ahmad Munir, a Faryab resident. 
“Right now, the city of Maimana is under Taliban siege. In such a situation, how can a person who has no experience, who does not know the region and who does not have relations with the people be a governor here?"" asked a Faryab resident. 
Some senators meanwhile said that the internal rift between the country’s politicians will not benefit the country and the ongoing peace efforts. 
“Afghanistan has many pains. There is a need for unity,” Senate Speaker Fazl Hadi Muslimyar said. 
“The appointment and removal are principled. We are aware of protests by some people. Efforts are underway to address the problem,” said Mohammad Amiri, a presidential spokesman. 
Following the rift, President Ghani appointed former Faryab governor Naqibullah Fayiq as a senator and bestowed him the Mir Bacha Khan Medal of Honor from the government to lessen the differences, but residents of the province said that they want a governor who is their own pick.

Afghan MPs Seek Government’s Clear Policy Towards Pakistan
","
Two lawmakers on Sunday said they see an unclear policy by the Afghan government’s foreign policy toward Pakistan, referring to recent remarks by President Ashraf Ghani and his National Security Advisor Hamdullah Mohib about Islamabad’s policies.
“Under the current situation and the ongoing peace process, unfortunately, there isn’t a unified view from the Republic. This is not in favor of the peace process and in complicates the current situation,” said Nazifa Yusufi Bek, an MP from Takhar.
“You have witnessed recently that Mr. President has had one view on Pakistan while his national security adviser Mr. Mohib has had another. Therefore, these conflicting views by politicians and government officials will lead the country towards further crisis. I hope that a written policy is prepared towards neighboring countries in the earliest time possible,” said Abdul Sattar Husaini, an MP from Farah.
On the first day of Eid (May 13, Thursday) President Ghani in a ceremony in Kabul provided details about his meeting with Pakistan’s Army Chief of Staff, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, and optimistically declared that Pakistan does not want the return of the Islamic emirate in Afghanistan.
“The Honorable Chief of Staff of Pakistan, when visiting Kabul with his colleagues, made it clear that the revival of the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan is not in the national interest of Pakistan, and they supported the republic.”
Two days after that, National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib harshly criticized Pakistan’s policies in Afghanistan during a visit to Nangarhar province on Saturday. 
“ISI, Pakistan’s intelligence agency, is not doing mercy on you (Taliban). They neither want you nor they will help to take power. All they have told you are a lie. The only thing they want from you is that they are sacrificing you for themselves and for their own war,” Mohib said.
The Presidential Palace rejected any deal with Pakistan and assured that Afghanistan has a unified policy toward Pakistan.
“The government and people of Afghanistan have always protested Pakistan’s role in the war in Afghanistan. In the new chapter of relations, Pakistan is expected to choose the path of friendship with the Afghan people and play a more practical role in advancing the Afghan Peace Process,” said Mohammad Amiri, deputy spokesman to President Ashraf Ghani.
Diplomatic relationships between Kabul and Islamabad have been marked with tensions over the last two decades.
However, the new government in Pakistan, led by Imran Khan, has assured the Afghan government of a positive change in its policy towards Afghanistan, but the Afghan government officials say Pakistan’s remarks are always symbolic.

Afghan Schools Lack Teachers, Textbooks
","
57 days after the start of the new school year (1400), the Ministry of Education is facing criticism for not solving the problem of a shortage of textbooks and teachers in schools.
Students at one of Herat’s schools say the shortage of teachers and textbooks causes many challenges.
These students complained that they are worried about their future, as the lack of textbooks and teachers in schools renders the act of getting an education meaningless.
""We cannot study without books, they are not available to us,"" said Mirwais, a student in Herat.
""I personally do not have textbooks. I cannot take notes, I cannot study. There are some challenges that stop us from learning,"" said Reja Mahmoodi, another student in Herat.
A small number of teachers in Herat schools consider the shortage of textbooks and teachers distressing.
""The lack of textbooks in the classrooms has left students with confusion and has bewildered them,"" said Abdul Qadir Movahed, a teacher in Herat.
Some members of Parliament, who criticize the government for not providing enough textbooks or hiring enough teachers in schools, say the dimished focus on the education system in the country is a betrayal by the government.
Ghazni MP Abdul Qayyum Sajjadi said: ""Afghanistan has a sick educational system that needs to be treated as soon as possible. This treatment may require serious actions by the government.""
The Ministry of Education says it is determined to solve all of these problems very soon.
Najiba Arian, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education, said: ""To address the shortage of teachers, we have plans to start the process of recruiting temporary, contract-based teachers, a series of paperwork processes are in motion. Once all these processes are completed, we will start recruiting new teachers. Besides this, more than 85% of the books that were planned to be printed in the current year are printed now. Once the printing process is wholly completed, we will start the process of carrying and distributing them to all provinces.
lack of textbooks, teachers, buildings, and security for the students has been a longstanding challenge to the education sector in Afghanistan.
The people of Afghanistan blame the government authorities for not paying significant attention to the education system and they say that although millions of dollars have been contributed to the education sector over the last two decades, problems were not solved and have increased.

Miller: Taliban Might Ramp Up Violence Post-Ceasefire
","
US and coalition forces commander, Gen. Scott Miller, has said that the Taliban might increase violence after the three-day ceasefire that ended on May 15, but he reiterated that the US will support Afghan forces until the full withdrawal of their troops from the country.
“We’re watching closely what the Taliban will do post the Eid ceasefire,” Miller said in an interview with the BBC. “Ideally, they would continue with the reduced violence because it is something that the Afghan people want. But the expectation is that they will pick up violence in the nearer term.” 
“I do expect that we’ve seen Taliban surge pressure on different provincial capitals,” he said as quoted by BBC. 
In response to a question about whether the US has failed in its mission in Afghanistan, he said: “Certainly, there were some victories along the way, but I think history will judge this and the future will tell the rest of the story.” 
Sources close to the Taliban said that there has been progress in the release of 7,000 prisoners of the group by the Afghan government. The sources said that the Taliban is expected to hold a session with the US about the withdrawal of American forces from the country. 
“Big hopes exist that the Taliban prisoners will be released and that the foreigners and the Taliban will achieve a new agreement on the withdrawal of American forces (from Afghanistan),” said Sayed Akbar Agha, a former Taliban commander. 
The Afghan government said that the release of prisoners will depend on agreements within the peace negotiations.

The Afghan government is expected to finalize the list of names for the High Council of Government, a formation that will work for building a consensus around peace and on other peace-related affairs at higher levels, according to a source who is familiar with President Ashraf Ghani’s recent meetings with political leaders.
The source said that discussions on finalizing the list of the members of the council are underway and that most of the members are political party leaders.
The political leaders, whose names are on the list, are expected to meet in a grand meeting to discuss the future of peace and war in the country.
The Presidential Palace said that the list is not final and that it has not been decided whether the council will have an advisory role in the peace process or have decision-making authority.
“It has not been finalized about how many parties will be there, what will its name be (of the council), what will be the limits be on its authorities and responsibilities. More consultations are needed. There is an agreement on one thing: that this is a political consensus from around the republic,” said Dawa Khan Minapal, a presidential spokesman.
Two lawmakers said that they see the problem in the limitation of power to some individuals at the Presidential Palace.  
“The Presidential Palace is run by four people: Fazli, Mohib, Ashraf Ghani and his wife. These four people are making decisions on Afghanistan. Otherwise, Ashraf Ghani is not consulting with the parliament,” said Shir Mohammad Akhundzada, an MP from Helmand. 
“Ashraf Ghani is seeking to be an undisputed president. The people of Afghanistan expect the President to build political consensus and this too, has a cost,” said Abdul Wali Niazi, an MP from Badakhshan. 
Sources said that more than 20 influential political figures will have membership of the council, but one member of Hizb-e-Islami said that despite efforts by the president to create the council and build a political consensus around peace, some groups within the government are trying to prevent the formation of the council. 
“The council was expected to be formed in eight days. The president started his meetings, but I think there are some groups who don’t see the formation of the council and a political consensus in their favor,” said Humayun Jarir, a Hizb-e-Islami member. 
“Anyone who is in favor of peace for real, should not follow division policy,” said Ahmad Wali Massoud, the head of the Ahmad Shah Massoud Foundation and a former ambassador.
Some politicians said that the rift over the removal of the Faryab governor and the new appointment for the province by the president, will affect Ghani’s relation with Abdul Rashid Dostum and that such attempts can harm political consensus.

Operations Begin to Retake Three Districts as Ceasefire Ends
","
Afghan forces have launched operations to retake three districts--one in Baghlan, one in Maidan Wardak and one in Logar province two days after a three-day ceasefire ended, according to army forces on the ground. 
The centers of Charkh district in Logar, Burka district in Baghlan and Nerkh district in Maidan Wardak fell to the Taliban weeks ago. 
“In order to deploy our forces in areas where our troops made a tactical retreat, there is a proper military plan. We will be redeployed in those areas with more power and the enemy will not be allowed to grow,” said Rohullah Ahmadzai, spokesman for Defense Ministry. 
A lawmaker from Baghlan said that after fall of the Burka district in the province, clashes have reached the outskirts of the city of Pul-e-Khumri. 
“Baghlan needs serious attention as it is an important province,” said Asadullah Shahbaz, an MP from Baghlan. “This is because it is a connecting point for nine northern provinces. If it faces a problem, nine provinces will face the problem.” 
“The government should have the feeling that when it loses one place, it should retake it. Or it should maintain that place primarily and it should review its decision about those places that have been lost,” said Mohibullah Zaheer, a military affairs analyst. 
Meanwhile, Second Vice President Sarwar Danesh blamed the Taliban for making excuses in the peace process. 
“The Taliban so far has left the negotiating table and a political solution by using different excuses; they are pushing for their military attacks, terror and violence,” Danesh said on Monday. 
 
Meanwhile, Nangarhar, Laghman, Maindan Wardak and Kunduz have faced attacks in the last 24 hours.
The Afghan army said that the Taliban has suffered “heavy losses” in Afghan forces operations, which has been denied by the group.

Local Elders Report Militant Presence North of Kabul City
","
Influential figures from the Kohdaman region, which encompasses seven districts of Kabul province all north of the city, report the presence of Taliban and Daesh militants in their area and attribute this to recent security incidents. Concern is growing among the people about safety, the elders said.
They said that the government’s inattention to the security of the Kohdaman region has made the area unsafe. 
Seven districts of Kabul, including Mir Bacha Kot, Kalakan, Qara Bagh, Istalif, Guldara,  Farza and Shakar Dara are known as the Kohdaman region. 
The elders said that the Friday’s blast at a mosque in Shakardara, attacks on buses and trucks that travel on the Kabul-North highway, attacks on power pylons and an explosion that targeted a bus carrying health workers have sparked rising concerns. Also, dozens of tankers were burned in fires in the Qala-e-Murad Bek area of Shakar Dara district this month. 
They said the government's inattention to the area has allowed such activities by terrorist groups. 
“We asked the central government many times, but it did not pay attention to the Kohdaman region,” said Lotfullah, a former mujahedeen leader in Kohdaman. 
“Bodies were found here. Their heads were chopped off. Journalists are the witnesses. We see that the government has ignored the north,” said Mawlagul Rasikh, head of the Kabul youth council. 
The residents of the region said that following the May 15 attack on a mosque in Shakar Dara district they started efforts to cooperate with security forces in arresting perpetrators. They said that after their mobilization, three people were arrested from the area by security forces on charges of ties with Daesh. 
“So far we have not received reports about whether it has been done by Daesh, Talib or the Haqqani network,” said Mohammad Gawhar Baburi, the district governor of Shakar Dara. 
Security agencies confirmed to TOLOnews the presence of Taliban and Daesh and other ""destructive"" groups in the region, but some sources say other groups have been activated in Shakar Dara and Guldara districts where they only focus on destroying and damaging electricity pylons. 
“Some irresponsible people misuse the situation to destroy power pylons,” said Mir Naeem Haidari, a close aide to former mujahedeen leader Mir Amanullah Guzar.  
“Some groups might be behind this (power pylon destruction). Some elders from Kohdaman or those who have an interest in such violence might have a hand in such matters,” said Sayed Fakhruddin Hashimi, a resident of the Kohdaman region.
Areas north of Kabul were the most secure in recent years, but in less than a month the area has witnessed attacks on two passengers’ buses, many targeted attacks, two attacks on fuel truck tankers, a blast at a mosque and the destruction of at least 10 power pylons.

Foreigners Travel Via Kabul to Reach Gulf States Amid COVID Bans
","
Recent limitations due to the coronavirus have pushed a large number of citizens from countries in the region, especially Pakistan, to use Afghanistan as a transit to other countries.
Officials from a COVID-19 testing center in Kabul said that on average at least 100 citizens of Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkey and India are tested in the laboratory every day.
Information obtained by TOLOnews shows that Saudi Arabia’s travel limitations to citizens from Bahrain, Nepal, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India and Turkey have pushed these citizens to travel to Kabul and spend a 15-day quarantine period here, and then travel to Saudi Arabia.
The laboratory in Kabul asks for passports from those travelers who want to be tested for COVID-19.
The Zain Nabi laboratory said that they have had 100 customers a day, most of them from Pakistan, over the last 45 days.
“80 percent are passengers bound for Saudi Arabia. 20 percent are those who travel to Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, India, Turkey, UAE, US and some European countries,” said Sediqullah Safi, a doctor at the lab.
Some Pakistani citizens told TOLOnews that Pakistan’s flights to Saudi Arabia have been stopped, therefore they are using Afghanistan to travel to Riyadh in order to not lose their jobs.
They said that they entered Kabul with tourist visas from Peshawar. Some of them who talked to TOLOnews said they were in Kabul for the last 18 days and are waiting for flights from Kabul to Riyadh.
“It is two or three months that positive cases of COVID-19 have increased, and Saudi Arabia has closed its flights and we have been made to wait,” said Mohammad Din Shah, a Pakistani citizen.
Akram Khan, a Pakistani citizen, said he lives in Pakistan with his wife and four children. He said he has been working in Saudi Arabia for the last 13 years and that he visits his family in Pakistan once a year for six months. Now, he said, his off days have been completed and he ha6d no option but to travel to Kabul to fly to Riyadh from here.
“After the increase in positive cases of COVID-19, Saudi Arabia stopped its flights from Pakistan and we had no option but to get a visa from the Afghan consulate in Peshawar and enter Kabul from Torkham. And now we are waiting for our flight to Riyadh,” Khan said.
An Emirates flight that landed in Kabul today had at least 400 passengers on board, most of them foreign citizens who used Afghanistan as a temporary station to travel to other countries, as some familiar with the matter said.
“We monitor passengers for PCR tests. If it has been more than 72 hours they are retested and it takes 15 minutes for this test to show its result,” said Rahmatullah Baraki, a doctor at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul.
Based on records of airport officials, at least 1,000 Pakistani citizens with Afghan visas have been registered at the airport in the last month.
“We are living in a village. At least 10 people from our village left. Other Pashtuns were not aware that our people are traveling through this (Kabul) route. Many Punjabis have also come here,” said Mohammad Din Shah, a Pakistani citizen.

Ghani: Afghanistan ‘Ready’ to Fight Taliban after US Pullout
","
President Ashraf Ghani said that the Afghan government is ready to fight against the Taliban after the full withdrawal of international troops from the country, reiterating that the key to peace talks is accepting the election as a way forward for Afghanistan’s future government.
“The threat of terrorism has changed. It has not disappeared. We are all agreed on this,” Ghani said in an interview with PBS on May 17. “The United States is committed to support things, providing support. This is financial, in the security area, in the economic area, in the humanitarian area, because the United States, fortunately, shares the values of supporting the gains of the last 20 years. And our discussion is enormously productive. The same, fortunately, applies to NATO members and non-NATO members who have been our partners.” 
President Ghani has recently held talks with influential political leaders, namely the reconciliation council chief Abdullah Abdullah, former president Hamid Karzai, former mujahedeen leader Abdul Rab Rasul Sayyaf, and others to build a consensus around peace and form a high-level state council.  
Sources familiar with the meetings said that the list of the members of the council will be finalized by the end of this week.  
Moreover, the Taliban has shown signs of willingness to resume the peace negotiations in Doha. But in Afghanistan violence remains increasingly high despite a three-day ceasefire from May 12 to May 15.
The Defense Ministry reported clashes in 18 provinces just two days after the end of the ceasefire. 
President Ghani once again reiterated that that “the key to a political dialogue is that the Taliban accept that the future political system of Afghanistan is based on elections.” 
“That is the fundamental bottom line. Other things are discussible, negotiable. But if that fundamental issue is not granted, then the question of rights and the question of gains that have occurred in the last 20 years, particularly vis-a-vis women, youth, minorities, all walks of life, will be put into question,” Ghani said as quoted by PBS. 
US and coalition forces commander, Gen. Scott Miller, said this week that the Taliban might increase violence after the three-day ceasefire that ended on May 15, but he reiterated that the US will support Afghan forces until the full withdrawal of their troops from the country. 
On Monday, some sources close to the Taliban said that there has been some progress in the release of 7,000 prisoners of the group by the Afghan government. They said that the Taliban is expected to hold a session with the US about the withdrawal of American forces from the country. 
But the Afghan government said that the release of prisoners will depend on agreements within the peace negotiations.

Taliban Ready to Resume Intra-Afghan Talks in Doha: Spokesman
","
As prospects for the resumption of peace talks between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban remain vague, a spokesman for the Taliban on Monday said that the group was ready to resume intra-Afghan talks in Doha—but gave no details about when the talks would start again.
“We are conducting regular meetings, the contact has not been cut off, we are ready for the talks to move forward,” said Mohammad Naeem, a spokesman for the Taliban in Doha.
“America has told the Taliban that they have raised the issue of their prisoners with the Afghan government and the issue will be solved and you (Taliban) should resume the talks,” said Mawlavi Qalamuddin, a former Taliban member.
“Whatever the Taliban want to say they should come and raise it at the peace negotiation table and we welcome that,” said Faraidoon Khawzon, a spokesman for the High Council of National Reconciliation (HCNR).
Last week negotiators from the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban held brief talks in Doha after a month's delay.
The Taliban had previously said that they will not participate in any talks until the US forces leave the country by May 1.
Under the US-Taliban peace deal signed in Doha last February, the US committed to leave the country by May 1, but US President Joe Biden extended the pullout deadline to September 11, 2021.
“We initiated the talks with commitment and seriousness and we are still prepared for negotiations,” said Ghulam Farooq Majroh, a member of the peace negotiating team representing the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in the talks with the Taliban.
The negotiating teams met in Doha on May 14 after a long pause. Sources familiar with the meeting said the Taliban has asked to maintain the Doha negotiations--with serious discussions-- but they want the final outcome to be achieved in Doha, not in Istanbul.
The Republic team said that efforts in Doha and Istanbul will help achieve results in the negotiations, but they stressed that the Taliban’s commitment is key.
The negotiations in Doha were stalled after the announcement of a delay in the US forces withdrawal in Afghanistan from the original May 1st deadline.

Over 100 Survivors of School Attack in 'Critical' Emotional State
","
 Almost 11 days after the deadly attack on the Sayed al-Shuhada school in Kabul, many survivors are still struggling with the psychological effects of the incident and remain in a state of shock. School officials say the students need treatment because so far they have not been able to forget the devastating incident that killed their classmates. 
The principal of the school said that at least 90 students were killed and nearly 250 more were wounded in the attack. Some figures show that at least 30 students were killed and wounded from just one class. 
“What haunts me are the voices of the wounded and the parents who were desperately shouting and searching for their children,” said Samira, a student at the school. 
“I will continue my classes no matter what happens while I am alive. This country will be prosperous one day,” said Sabera, a student at the school.  
“When electricity is out, I fear a lot. I was so close; therefore, I was terrified by its sound. I get scared when I hear loud sounds,” said Nazanin Danesh, a student at the school. 
Fatima, a student in the 11th grade, opened her mouth to speak after 10 days, but what she says is mostly about the bitter stories of the triple blasts near their school that killed her classmates and friends. 
“When I remember, I lose hope. This much hope I had, this much effort I made, all vanished at one moment,” Fatima said. 
A psychologist who visits the school every day said two days back that over 100 students were in critical condition psychologically. These students were taken for treatment, the psychologist Zahra Husaini said.  
“In order to help them recover, we try to help them acknowledge the reality of what they experienced,” Husaini said. 
One class where at least 40 students were studying normally has had only two students attending over the last 11 days. Buckets of flowers have been put on all desks where students once sat. One of the two students who attended the class on Tuesday was wounded in the attack but survived. There is no news on the more than 30 remaining students in that specific class, said TOLOnews reporter Zahra Rahimi, who visited the class. 
“The martyrs' families said that the government should ensure security and then they we will send their children to school. They said that they do not want their remaining children to be targeted by such an incident,” said Aqila Tawakuli, the principal of the school. 
The latest figures from school officials show that all 90 students who were killed in the blasts were aged between 13 and 18 years old.

US Forces at Bagram Scrapping Vehicles, Equipment
","
As the US forces have announced withdrawal from Afghanistan, dozens of trailer trucks loaded with scrap from destroyed vehicles and equipment that belonged to American troops are leaving the Bagram Airfield on a daily basis as the process continues in full swing. 
Those who purchase the material say that so far the scrap has been worth millions of dollars.
Some residents of Bagram said that such equipment should have been handed over to Afghan forces instead of being scrapped by the US military. But US forces have said the equipment will be scrapped so it does not fall into enemy hands. 
According to Bagram residents, over 20 to 30 trailer trucks loaded with scrapped equipment leave the airfield every day and are sold outside. 
“Their spare parts are good, but not when they are scrapped. Now that they are leaving, they are scrapping all their equipment at the base,” said Haji Hasib, a Bagram resident. 
“All the vehicles are armored Lexus and Hilux SUVs. They bring it from the provinces to the Bagram Airfield where they have equipment that presses it. Each of their vehicles is worth over 100,000 dollars. They are all from the Afghan nation's blood,” said Shakir, a Bagram resident. 
Scrapped parts of armored vehicles, military equipment, other vehicles and electronics are seen among the scrapped equipment that is taken out of the airfield. 
“They are not handed over (to Afghan forces). They are brought here and are scrapped and are sold to our Afghans for the price of iron scrap,” said Mohammad Asif, a Bagram resident. 
“There are various things among them,” said Shakir, a Bagram resident. 
The Afghan government has said that equipment worth $1 billion will be handed over to the Afghan forces. 
“They should be handed over to Afghan forces because they are at war. Our security is not good. We are in dire need of them,” said Abdul Wahab, a Bagram resident. 
Bagram Airfield has been the biggest airbase of the US military in Afghanistan over the last 20 years. US forces started a withdrawal on May 1, a process that is expected to be completed by Sept. 11.

Protestors Block Access to Govt Offices in Faryab
","
Protestors in the northern province of Faryab on Tuesday blocked the doors of at least five government offices as anger continues to grow over President Ashraf Ghani's appointment of a new governor for the province.
Protestors threatened to close down all government departments in the province if their demands about the appointment of the governor are not met.
Protestors on Tuesday closed the doors of the provincial municipality office, the department of women’s affairs, the department of labor and the department of public works. 
Officials of the Independent Directorate of Local Governance (IDLG) have said that the people of Faryab must accept the appointment of a new governor that is based on the law.
“Our civil protests will be expanded, if they paved the way for violence, we will attack their (military) division,” said Atta Mohammad Faizi, a member of Junbish Milli Party.
“The people want democracy to be demonstrated in its true spirit, the governor must be someone who knows the geography of Faryab,” said Ehsanullah Qawanch, a protestor in Faryab.
“If the Afghan govt does not honor the legitimate demands of the people of Faryab, there is the possibility that the scope of these protests will be expanded,” said Ehsan Nairo, a spokesman to Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum.
This comes two days after Daud Laghmani was appointed as the new governor of Faryab at an Afghan Army facility in Faryab.
“I have been appointed as governor based on the prevailing laws of Afghanistan and will use all my abilities for the service of the Faryab people,” said newly appointed governor Daud Laghmani.
“The post of a governor is a political post not an elected post--the governors are appointed based on the order of the president of Afghanistan,” said Nargis Momand Hassanzai, a spokeswoman for IDLG.

Fighting Intensifies in East With End of 3-Day Ceasefire
","
Government officials in the eastern part of the country say there have been heavy clashes between Afghan security forces and the Taliban for several days. 
The officials added that after the 3-day Eid ceasefire, the Taliban and the security forces have started fighting in Khogyani, Shirzad, and Hesarak district in Nangarhar, and Dolat Shah and Ali Sheng districts in Laghman province, where the Taliban have suffered heavy casualties so far. 
Nangarhar's governor, Zia-ul-Haq Amarkhail, says that Pakistani citizens, those from Khyber Agency and Mohmand Agency on the other side of the Durand Line, are along those killed in clashes, and their bodies have been left on the battlefields; but the Taliban has not commented on these claims.
“The Taliban has launched a campaign in Pakistani Madrassas (religious training centers) and ask the people to join them in their war against Afghanistan, to take over districts and outposts, saying that anything they find there (in outposts and districts) would be their property,” Nangarhar's governor added.
Abdul Qayyum Hotak, police chief of Sorkhrud district in Nangarhar, said: "" Afghan security forces have launched a joint operation in Shirzad and Hesarak districts, which is progressing well."" 
The head of the Nangarhar Provincial Council called on the central government to extend the ongoing operations in Hesarak and Shirzad districts. 
Ahmad Ali Hazrat, head of the Nangarhar Provincial Council, said: “In the Khogyani, Hesarak, and Shirzad districts, 800 Pakistani fighters from the Jaish-e-Muhammad and Lashkar-e-Taiba groups are fighting on the frontlines alongside the Taliban against Afghan security forces.” 
“Our diplomacy system is really imperfect. Every day we witness Pakistanis in the frontlines, their bodies being left on battlefields;  we ask the Pakistan government about this, they summon our ambassador. Our diplomatic side needs to be empowered and the evidence (the presence of Pakistanis in the frontlines) should be used in our favor,” said a member of the Nangarhar Provincial Council, Naser Kamawal.

Atmar to Pakistan: Practical Steps Needed for Afghan Peace
","
Afghan Foreign Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar on Tuesday spoke about a recent trip of a high-level Pakistani delegation to Kabul. He said the two sides reached agreements about the peace process in Afghanistan, but the two countries now need to take practical steps to expand bilateral cooperation on peace in Afghanistan.
Atmar made it clear that Afghanistan will not trust any sort of commitment unless practical steps are taken. 
“A Pakistani delegation came here, the delegation made a number of commitments, currently we have these agreements on the table,” said Atmar.
Atmar, who recently visited The Hague, told reporters in Kabul on Tuesday that no one will be allowed to commit crimes in the name of peace.

Abdullah Camp Critical of Year-Old Political Deal With Ghani
","
A year has passed since President Ashraf Ghani and his political rival Abdullah Abdullah signed a power-sharing deal after months of political discord that critics and analysts believe could have pushed the country toward a new crisis if not resolved.
The political tension emerged as a consequence of the disputed presidential election of 2019. As a result, the two leaders, Ghani and Abdullah, held inauguration ceremonies on the same day in their adjacent respective palaces. Ghani was declared president by the Independent Election Commission after earning a slightly higher percentage than his rival Abdullah.
But after months of political stalemate, a political agreement was signed between Ghani and his political opponent Abdullah Abdullah that outlined the structure of a future government in which each side would have a 50 percent share.
Later on, Abdullah Abdullah was assigned to lead the High Council of National Reconciliation (HCNR).
But the HCNR on Tuesday said that many parts of the agreement weren’t implemented--only the establishment of the peace council and the appointment of cabinet members.
According to HCNR, the appointment of the ambassadors, the appointment of senators and the establishment of a high council of government were also key elements of the agreement that have not been implemented so far.
“During the past one year, except for the appointment of cabinet members and the creation of a high council of national reconciliation, other parts of the political agreement have not been implemented,” said Faraidon Khawzon, a spokesman for HCNR.
“Consensus includes both politicians and those outside politics because we have university lecturers there, media, youth and women, if these segments of the society aren't included, this will endanger the future of Afghanistan,” said MP Mirwais Yasini.
“Jamiat-e-Islami Afghanistan knew from the beginning that Mr. Ghani is not committed to any agreement,” said Abdul Fatah Ahmadzai, a spokesman of the Jamiat-e-Islami party (Salahuddin Rabbani faction).
Some excerpts from the agreement:
The five-page proposed agreement-- originally in Dari -- describes the government role given to Abdullah Abdullah and specifies his authorities and privileges and areas where his team will participate.
The two sides have agreed in principle on the plan, according to Abdullah and Ghani’s aides, but discussions are still underway about details. The agreement has been proposed by Abdullah's side to Ghani.
Based on the agreement, the High Council of Government will be established to ensure political consensus in the country. Political leaders and national figures will be members.
This council, according to the agreement, will consult with the president on important national matters.
Another aspect of the plan is the establishment of the High Council of National Reconciliation led by Abdullah Abdullah, from which he can issue executive orders. The council will have five deputies from the two teams.
The council members will be selected by the director in consultation with the president, political leaders, people from the two sides, speakers of the parliament houses and the civil society and elites, according to the agreement.
Based on the agreement, Abdullah will lead the peace process, the meetings of the reconciliation council, and he will appoint its members and employees, including the employees of the State Ministry for Peace Affairs.
The council itself has been given the authority to specify, approve and lead all affairs related to the peace process, the agreement says. The decisions and enactments at the council will be made by a majority of votes of its members.

Khalilzad Says Fears of Taliban Conquering Kabul Are Overblown
","
As US has started the withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan after 20 years of engagement, special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad on Tuesday said that the prediction that the Taliban will quickly overrun Afghan forces and conquer Kabul after full withdrawal of international troops are unduly pessimistic. 
“I personally believe that the statements that their forces will disintegrate and the Talibs will take over in short order are mistaken,” Khalilzad told the House Foreign Affairs Committee as quoted in a report by AP. 
Violence has remained high in the country even after a three-day ceasefire from May 12 to May 15. The Defense Ministry reported clashes in 18 provinces just a day after the ceasefire ended. 
Khalilzad said that the Afghan government and the Taliban should do their part in the peace process. He stressed the need for Pakistan’s role in the peace efforts in Afghanistan.  
“We remain in close touch with Pakistan leaders, pressing them to exercise their considerable leverage over the Taliban to reduce violence and support a negotiated settlement,” Khalilzad said. “I believe Pakistan understands that the protracted war in Afghanistan is not in its interest.” 
But US lawmakers expressed their concern and skepticism over the future of the country once American troops leave Afghanistan. 
“It seems all but certain the Taliban will try to overrun the country and return it to a pre-9/11 state after we have withdrawn,” Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, said. “They’ve already ramped up their attacks, taking new territory and bases since the (Biden) announcement was made. Without a military presence in country, the US is giving them room to deepen their relationship with terrorist groups like al-Qaida, who may seek to launch external attacks on us and our allies from the country once again.”  
Some US lawmakers expressed their concerns about the future of women rights in the country once the international troops leave the country.
But Khalilzad said that the Taliban should also understand that the Afghanistan of today is very different than it was 20 years ago.

US Lawmakers Seek Continued Efforts in Afghanistan
","
Eleven members of the US House of Representatives--10 Democrats and one Republican--wrote a letter to President Joe Biden on the “enduring interests and ideals that should continue to guide US efforts in Afghanistan even as the armed forces end their mission in the country” amid the start of the withdrawal of American troops from the country.
The letter was signed by US Reps. Tom Malinowski (D), Jim Langevin (D), Mike Waltz (R), Stephanie Murphy (D), William R. Keating (D), Chrissy Houlahan (D), Colin Allred (D), Dean Phillips (D), David Cicilline (D), Gerald E. Connolly (D) and Bill Foster (D).
The withdrawal of the US military, which began on May 1 and is scheduled to continue until Sept. 11, 2021, has raised concerns over the future of Afghanistan, especially gains achieved in women’s rights, girls' education and the growth of civil society, which includes a free media.
The lawmakers said they hope President Biden will continue to make clear that ""America’s policy in Afghanistan is to ensure the survival and success of that government and of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces and to stand by those Afghans who bet their lives on the future the US promised them.""
They mentioned that the capabilities of Afghanistan’s security forces will determine whether the Taliban succeeds in “reimposing medieval rule over Afghanistan’s 40 million people; whether al-Qaeda and Daesh reestablish terrorist sanctuary there; and whether the country once again unravels in civil war.”
The peace process, meanwhile, has moved forward haltingly, especially after President Biden announced the full withdrawal of US forces by Sept. 11. The Taliban has recently expressed their intentions to resume the talks, but their unwillingness to participate at a UN-led conference in Turkey has delayed the event multiple times since April.  
The lawmakers, pointing to the abilities of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, said if there is any prospect of a just, peaceful settlement in Afghanistan, it will happen “only after the Afghan military demonstrates to the Taliban that their insurgency will not triumph on the battlefield.”
The congress members reiterated that the United States needs a strategy to sustain its Afghan military partners after the full withdrawal of American troops from the country.  
Violence has remained high in Afghanistan despite a three-day ceasefire from May 12 to May 15. A day after the ceasefire ended, security agencies reported clashes between government forces and the Taliban in 18 provinces.   
The lawmakers said that Afghans have long borne the overwhelming brunt of the counterterrorism fight in their country and that they remain heavily dependent on US and international enablers, including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets and maintenance and repair for their equipment.  
Meanwhile, the lawmakers said that they will support generous US funding for Afghanistan’s civil society and for its social and economic development. But international assistance will only help if there is security for the Afghan people and proper on-the-ground oversight of that aid, they said.
They added that if security deteriorates, those Afghans most at risk may need to find safety elsewhere.
Citing the targeted killings of civil leaders and the Kabul school attack that killed over 80 female students, the representatives wrote: ""We will support generous US funding for Afghanistan’s civil society and for its social and economic development. But international assistance will only help if there is security for the Afghan people and proper on-the-ground oversight of that aid. And if security deteriorates, those Afghans most at risk may need to find safety elsewhere.""
The representatives wrote that the Special Immigration Visas (SIV) for translators, contractors, security personnel and others who helped US forces should be expedited, along with the US Refugee Admissions Programs ""to provide the response necessary to address this issue over the next few months.""
""We must move swiftly to expedite life-saving programs that provide a path to safety for those who loyally worked alongside US troops, diplomats, and contractors. To that end, we will work with you to address challenges facing the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) and the US Refugee Admissions Programs in providing the response necessary to address this issue over the next few months,"" the lawmakers urged.
The letter went on to say: ""Other Afghans, including women’s rights activists, civic leaders, journalists, and elected officials, would face a credible fear of persecution if the Taliban return to power,"" and suggested a system be developed for ""in country processing of Afghans in this category"" to allow for earlier vetting if it becomes necessary to process their complaints quickly in the future.  
Recently, Afghan contractors who worked with US and coalition forces in Afghanistan held two gatherings during which they expressed their concerns over their safety as well as their familiess’ safety after foreign troops leave the country.
The lawmakers said that the Taliban-US agreement will compel the contractors’ departure as well as those who provide most of the mentioned functions, including surveillance and reconnaissance.
The lawmakers also expressed their concerns about reports of Turkey considering removing their security forces that currently protect the International Hamid Karzai Airport in Kabul, but they reiterated that there is a need for continued US funding to help Afghanistan maintain critical military capabilities.
Echoing recent remarks by some American military officials, US lawmakers said that the Taliban continues its efforts to remove the Afghan government by force, suggesting that it is time to consider a tougher approach against its international backers, including potential sanctions.
This comes as US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad on Tuesday said that the prediction that the Taliban will quickly overrun Afghan forces and conquer Kabul after full US withdrawal is unduly pessimistic.
“I personally believe that the statements that their forces will disintegrate and the Talibs will take over in short order are mistaken,” Khalilzad told the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
Khalilzad said that the Afghan government and the Taliban should do their part in the peace process. He stressed the need for Pakistan’s role in the peace efforts in Afghanistan.
On May 17, President Ashraf Ghani said that the Afghan government is ready to fight against the Taliban after the full withdrawal of international troops from the country, reiterating that the key to peace talks is to accept the election as a way forward for Afghanistan’s future government.

Formation of Supreme State Council Nearly Complete: Sources
","
Three sources on Wednesday said that the Supreme State Council is expected to be finalized soon, however, more decisions need to be made about the role of the council, specifically whether or not it will be a decision-making or advisory body.
According to the sources, the conflict over the appointment of the new governor of Faryab has now raised questions about the presence of Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum on the council.
Meanwhile, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of the Hizb-e-Islami party, said that he will not participate in the council if it does not have decision-making authority.
According to the sources, recently a meeting was held between Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the High Council for National Reconciliation, former president Hamid Karzai and former jihadi leader Abdul Rab Rassoul Sayyaf and the discussion focused on the structure of the Supreme State Council.
“Based on the agreement made between the President, Mr. Hamid Karzai and Mr. Hekmatyar, the council shouldn’t have more than 8 members. The decisions of this council should be resolute in relation to all major national issues, but there are some friends at the Presidential Palace who want to replace the High Council for National Reconciliation with the new council,” said Humayoun Jarir, a member of the Hizb-e-Islami party.
“Those who are supposed to be part of this council, and the structure which is expected to be created, should form a supreme state council in a true sense where discussions can be held on issues of national importance and decisions can be made,” said Fawzia Koofi, a member of the peace negotiating team representing the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in the talks with the Taliban.
The Presidential Palace meanwhile said that President Ghani is waiting to get the views of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Salahuddin Rabbani, the leader of the main faction of Jamiat-e-Islami.
“Positive efforts are underway, the doors of politicians have been knocked-on, the president is also inviting the politicians, we hope that the council will be successful so that bloodshed can be stopped,” said Zuhra Mutahar Ahmadzai, the deputy head of the HCNR.
“The proposal to establish the Supreme State Council was recommended by Marshal Dostum. The establishment of this council will prevent incidents similar to Faryab. Therefore, Marshal Dostum will be part of this council. If he himself wasn’t in Kabul, he will designate someone else for membership,” said Enayatullah Babur Farahmand, the deputy head of the HCNR.
Based on the political agreement signed last year between President Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, the Supreme State Council will be established to ensure political consensus in the country. Political leaders and national figures will be members.

Herat Man Describes Year-Long Detainment, Torture
","
Mohammad Shekib, a man from Herat province, was taken hostage by the Taliban a year ago and was released on Tuesday. 
He says that the one-year imprisonment totally changed his life and his hair and mustache have become completely white due to torture and other psychological pressure.
Shekib, 32, says his Taliban captors threatened to kill him on a daily basis.
Shekib was an employee of Herat's water supply and sewage department and was abducted by the Taliban on the Herat-Kabul highway in Ghazni province a year ago.
Shekib has now rejoined his family.
“During this one year, ten times I felt that my soul was separated from my body because of the situation that I passed through there. I feel that 20 years of my life have been lost during this one-year imprisonment by the Taliban; it has had a major negative impact on me,” said Shekib.
A few others among Shekib’s colleagues were also taken by the Taliban and Shekib does not have hope they will be found alive. 
“In Afghanistan, the youth and professional people are being killed. I saw many people in Taliban custody, including a professional engineer who was in custody because he was an engineer,” said Mohammad Shekib.
Shekib’s detention has also left a major negative mpact on his family.
“We did not have even a single happy moment in our life during the past one year that my brother was in the Taliban’s custody,” said Najibullah Afzalzada, Shekib’s brother.
“It is a miracle that my brother Shekib is now with us, we never thought that he would return home,” said Afzalzada.
Shekib was on his way to Kabul to complete his masters degree, when he was kidnapped.

Qureshi Critical of Mohib’s Statement on Pakistan’s Afghan Policy
","
Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Wednesday responded to Afghanistan’s National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib’s recent criticism of Pakistan’s policy on Afghanistan. The Pakistani Foreign Minister said that on the one hand, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani urges Pakistan for cooperation and, on the other hand, levels baseless allegations against Islamabad.
Speaking in a session of Pakistan’s parliament, Qureshi asked Ghani to decide what he wants from Pakistan.
Meanwhile, the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) in reference to Qureshi’s remarks said that Afghanistan considers it its responsibility to tell the truth.
“I want to ask Afghanistan’s President Ashraf Ghani:  On the one hand you are asking Pakistan to help, but, on the other hand, your employee levels allegations against Pakistan and criticizes the Pakistani institutions. For god's sake, what do you want? We want peace, we want friendship, we want stability, we want regional connectivity, we want economic cooperation, we want bilateral trade, we want to shift geopolitics to geoeconomics. But what do you want? Make up your minds, make up your minds,” said Qureshi.
Last week Mohib in address to a gathering in the eastern province of Nangarhar strongly criticized Pakistan’s Afghan policy and said that Pakistan’s intelligence service--the ISI--is not supposed to have mercy on the Afghans.
“The government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is obliged to tell its people the truth as it sees fit, the concerns of the Afghan people regarding terrorism are shared with Pakistan on a regular basis,” said Hamed Tahzeeb, a deputy spokesman at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Afghan Foreign Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar on Tuesday spoke about a recent trip of a high-level Pakistani delegation to Kabul. He said the two sides reached agreements about the peace process in Afghanistan, but the two countries now need to take practical steps to expand bilateral cooperation on peace in Afghanistan.
Atmar made it clear that Afghanistan will not trust any sort of commitment unless practical steps are taken.
“A Pakistani delegation came here, the delegation made a number of commitments, currently we have these agreements on the table,” said Atmar.
“We have not pursued a clear policy toward Pakistan and so far we have not managed to recognize Pakistan in a true sense,” said MP Ibdalullah Mohammadi.
“Pakistan should act honestly with us,” said MP Robina Jalali.

NZ Exits Afghanistan, Leaves Legacy of Major Solar Power Project
","
New Zealand forces are ending their 20-year mission in Afghanistan this month, but they have left behind an essential project in Bamiyan province, the Renewable Energy Program, which has enabled the residents of the central province to have access to sustainable electricity. 
The project that cost $14 million was commissioned in 2012 and was ready for use in 2013, covering the city of Bamiyan, which attracts tourists from within and outside Afghanistan every year. 
Bamiyan residents make up almost 60 percent of the nation's solar power users, according to the country’s power distributor, Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS). The company earns 26 million Afs (over $330,000) a year from solar energy users, with 75 percent of that income from solar energy users in Bamiyan. The company has almost 4,500 customers in the city of Bamiyan. 
A small number of Bamiyan residents have access to power, but the solar energy they use is more sustainable compared to other parts of the country. It is not affected by damage to power pylons or vulnerable to technical problems with power from Uzbekistan. 
“We always have access to electricity. The button is under our control. It is safe from terrorists’ threats,” said Sayed Mohammad Kabir Tabish, a Bamiyan resident. 
“We have been using this power for almost 10 years. It has never been cut off,” said Sedaqat, a Bamiyan resident. 
Bamiyan is not connected to the national power network and it is not clear when it will benefit from imported electricity. 
A civil society activist in Bamiyan, Latifa Nasiri, said the project needs to be extended as it is a main demand of the Bamiyan residents. 
“Electricity has lit our houses and has helped us get access to technology,” said Amin Hamta, a Bamiyan resident. 
An energy expert said it takes more time to distribute imported power or electricity produced by local dams.  
“It takes six years for a hydropower project to be completed, but the same project takes one year for solar energy,” said Shakibullah Hedayat, a renewable energy expert. 
Currently DABS distributes less than 2 megawatts of power to 4,450 subscribers in the city of Bamiyan. One megawatt of the power is provided by the project to nearly 3,000 subscribers.
A big part of Afghanistan’s power is provided by imported electricity from Central Asian countries, but the power supply, which mainly serves Kabul, is vulnerable to a lack of security. DABS said last week that 13 power pylons were either damaged or destroyed by explosions in the last three weeks, mainly in the north of Kabul as well as in Baghlan province. This led to continued intermittent power outages in Kabul that still continue.

Laghman: ANDSF Retreat from Besieged Center of Dawlat Shah
","
According to the sources, the center of the district is now under Taliban influence.  Afghan forces retreated from the center of Dawlat Shah district in Laghman province on Thursday, two sources from the province reported, saying the decision to move came after the area was surrounded by the Taliban for months. 
According to the sources, the center of the district is now under Taliban control.  
Dawlat Shah district is located 47 kilometers north of Mehtarlam city, the center of Laghman, and shares a border with Panjshir province.  
The district had been besieged by the Taliban for the last six months, sources said. 
“In the past six months, more than 15 security force members were killed and there was no way to take the wounded out of the district,” the sources said. 
The Taliban claimed to have captured the district government buildings. 
The Ministry of Defense said that Afghan forces will soon push the Taliban back from the area. 
Provincial council members said that the Taliban attacked the district in the early hours of Thursday morning and “nearly 30 security forces members were killed and wounded."" They said  ""the Taliban have also captured several security outposts.” 
“We contacted people and they told us that clashes are still ongoing in Dawlat Shah,” said Gulzar Sangarwal, a member of the provincial council.
The district borders Alishing district, and Nuristan, Panjshir and Kapisa provinces. 
“Claims of Dawlat Shah district falling are false. The security forces are present there,” said Rohaullah Ahamdzai, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.
In the meantime, sources said that the local government and Taliban have extended the three days Eid ceasefire for another month in Alingar district of Laghman.  
“They (Taliban) have come from Alingar district to Dawlat Shah for war. Not only from Alingar but also from neighboring provinces such as Kunar, Nuristan and Nangarhar. The Taliban have come to Laghman for war,” said Zayfonon Safi, an MP from Laghman. 
Before this, the security forces also retreated from Burka district in Baghlan and Nerkh district in Maidan Wardak province.  
The residents of Jalriz district of Maidan Wardak and MPs from southern provinces have gathered in Kabul to bring attention to the security situation in their provinces. 
Toryalai, a resident of Jalriz said: “The situation in Jalriz is very bad and only three villages remain--and they are also under siege by the Taliban, and the Taliban is searching the people’s houses.”  
At least nine civilians, including women and children, were killed in a roadside mine blast in Lashkargah, the capital of Helmand province, according to local officials.

US General to Recommend Post-Pullout Plan for Afghanistan
","
Gen. Frank McKenzie, the commander of US Central Command said Wednesday he will make recommendations to US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in early June on how to monitor and fight “terrorist groups” in Afghanistan from beyond its borders after troops withdrawal, AP reported.
Gen. McKenzie said negotiations with Afghanistan’s neighbors for overflight rights and troop basing are “moving forward” but will take time, the report said.
As a result, he said, the way the United States keeps an eye on the terrorist threat and aids the Afghan military will evolve as agreements are reached or security conditions on the ground change.
He cautioned that this will be a “taxing time” for the Afghan military and “the risk is high.”
Speaking to reporters from The Associated Press and ABC News traveling with him to the Middle East, McKenzie declined to provide details about the recommendations he will make to Austin.
He said he will also provide cost estimates for keeping surveillance aircraft over Afghanistan regularly enough to keep track of terrorist groups after the US pullout is completed no later than Sept. 11.
McKenzie has made it clear that without any bases in neighboring countries, it will require far more aircraft to keep watch over Afghanistan because they will have to fly for four hours to six hours from other US military installations in the Middle East.
The flight distance severely limits the amount of time the aircraft can spend in the air over Afghanistan.
This comes as eleven members of the US House of Representatives--10 Democrats and one Republican--wrote a letter to President Joe Biden on the “enduring interests and ideals that should continue to guide US efforts in Afghanistan even as the armed forces end their mission in the country” amid the start of the withdrawal of American troops from the country.

“There are some issues that need to be resolved, we won't say there is a disagreement, but first we need to address the issue of numbers and see how many people should be there--we want it to be effective and comprehensive. Second, the authorities of this council should be decided because all political parties want this to be decision-making body,” said Saadati.
“The government should assess capabilities and determine which political party, which jihadi or ethnic movement can work in close coordination with the government for the defense of the nation,” added Saadati.

Stoltenberg said that “first, we plan to provide advice and capacity-building support to Afghan security institutions.” This will also include “continued financial support to the Afghan security forces,” he said.
Second, Stoltenberg said, NATO is “planning to provide military education and training outside Afghanistan, focusing on Special Operations Forces.”
And third, he said, they are “planning to fund the provision of services, including support for the functioning of Kabul airport.” 
He said that all this will enable NATO allies and the broader international community to continue to help the Afghan people and contribute to the peace efforts.”
This comes as US and coalition forces have started withdrawal from Afghanistan this month. But the plan has been accompanied by concerns about the future of the country’s achievements in the last two decades, including women’s rights, as well as the political future of the country.

Mixed Views in US on Post-Withdrawal Scenario in Afghanistan
","
A number of US senators on Thursday expressed mixed reactions to a plan for monitoring Afghanistan from beyond its borders and said that a complete retreat from the country will make it difficult for the United States to provide effective support to Afghan forces.
This comes a day after top US Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie said he will make recommendations to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in early June on how to monitor and fight “terrorist groups” in Afghanistan from beyond its borders after troops withdrawal.
In their testimonies before the US Senate, Pentagon officials noted that the United States was able to monitor insurgent groups in Afghanistan without having a military presence in the country.  
“We have the capabilities to be able to posture in the region where it is required,” said Gen. Matthew G. Trollinger, Deputy Director for Political-Military Affairs. ""We have the capabilities to able to monitor potential adversaries, track these adversaries and then strike when conditions permit.”
But some US senators said that a complete withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan will obstruct America’s effective cooperation with the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) to tackle threats arising from terror groups.
“We must look to transition to a new counterterrorism architecture in the region to continue to degrade al Qaeda, ISIS and other terrorist groups and prevent their ability to attack our homeland,” Senator Jack Reed said. “CENTCOM commander General McKenzie recently provided the committee some assurances that such a counter-terrorism posture in the region was possible.”
“A complete withdrawal of US troops will make it much harder and more expensive to effectively support our Afghan security partners,” said Senator Jim Inhofe.
“We are working to develop the options to be able to provide the type of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and other necessary elements to maintain our counterterrorism capability,” said David Helvey, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs.
Meanwhile, US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad this week said that talks between the United States and Afghan neighbors are underway about how to monitor the situation in Afghanistan. 
“The Taliban face a fundamental choice between two very different futures: they can enhance and embrace a negotiated path to peace, make a transition from violent insurgency to a political movement and be part of a nation that enjoys respect in the global community. But if they pursue a military takeover, they will face isolation, regional opposition, sanctions and international opposition,” Khalilzad said.
Moreover, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Friday said as the alliance’s military presence is ending in Afghanistan, but added that NATO is opening a new chapter in the country and that its future support “will have three main pillars.”
According to a statement by NATO, the two leaders also discussed the fight against terrorism in Iraq, the Sahel region, and Afghanistan.
Stoltenberg said that “first, we plan to provide advice and capacity-building support to Afghan security institutions.” This will also include “continued financial support to the Afghan security forces,” he said.
This comes at a time that the prospect for a negotiated settlement of the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan remains vague and the level of violence continues to rise in various regions of the country.

Afghans Who Worked with German Troops Seek Protection
","
Some Afghans who have worked with German troops in Afghanistan, especially in the north, expressed their concerns about their future and said they see a big threat to their lives after the coalition forces leave the country in the next few months.
The Afghan contractors held a protest outside German troops’ base in the city of Mazar-e-Sharif, seeking asylum and protection.
One of them who wished not to be named over security reasons said he worked with German armed forces for nine years and that three of his colleagues who worked with the forces were killed.
“If the staff is not supported, it will not only be a concern for us but for our families, too,” the contractor said.
A small number of them who held a protest outside German troops base in Balkh chanted the slogans of “don’t leave us alone” in Deutsch.
“You have seen targeted attacks… We are concerned. We feel insulted in society. We are labeled wrongly for working with them [German armed forces],” said Najibullah, a former Afghan contractor with German forces.
“Everyone’s safety should be ensured. Same should be for us as their former staff,” said Samad, a former Afghan contractor with German forces.
“Those who have worked with them [German forces] are all under threat. The security situation in Afghanistan is changing every day. Therefore, we are here to ask for our rights so that we get their response and their final decision,” an Afghan, who has worked with Germans, said, requesting not to be named.
Quoted by Germany’s DPA news agency on April 18, German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said her country will not let down its Afghan staff as the international military mission in the country winds down after at least two decades of war.
“I feel it is Germany’s sincere duty to not leave these people without protection now that we will permanently withdraw,” she said.
US President Joe Biden and NATO in April announced that they would withdraw their troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11. The withdrawal began on May 1st. Germany is the second-largest contingent with about 1,100 troops.
The decision has raised concerns about Afghanistan’s political future and that it could erupt into another civil war, providing al Qaeda space in which to rebuild and plan new attacks on the US and other targets.
Based on figures by Germany’s Defense Ministry as mentioned in a Reuters report in April, German forces employ about 300 Afghans as interpreters and in other jobs.
The report says that since 2013 Germany has admitted nearly 800 Afghans at risk in their own country after working for the foreign military, as well as about 2,500 family members.

Afghans Condemn Israeli Aggression in Palestine

Afghans in various rallies in Kabul and other parts of the country on Friday announced their solidarity with Palestinians and condemned the Israeli aggression in Gaza. 
Hamas and Israel agreed to a ceasefire after 11 days of bloody violence that took hundreds of lives. The ceasefire came into effect on Friday morning. 
In a rally in Kabul, Hizb-e-Islami leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar called Israel’s attacks in Gaza as a crime against humanity and criticized the silence in the Muslim world against the aggression. 
“Palestine is the heart of the Muslim world, but Israel is a piousness sword of western imperialism,” Hekmatyar said. “It is a shame for the Muslim world that they are not able to defend the al Aqsa Mosque.” 
“It is a shame. Israel will vanish if the 53 Muslim nations get together,” said former MP Abdul Sattar Khawasi. 
Some Kabul residents who attended the rally said they are ready to protect the people in Gaza.

Dostum’s Aides Seek Establishment of Federal Govt as Rifts Deepen
","
Some aides to Marshal Dostum have sought the establishment of a federal government in north and northeastern Afghanistan following days of the rift over the appointment of the new government in Faryab. 
The request has come from leadership members of the National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan, or Junbish-e-Milli, led by former vice president Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum. 
Junbish members did not speak on the record about this matter, but angry protestors in Faryab on Friday chanted slogans in support of the establishment of a federal government in the country. 
The tensions erupted when President Ghani appointed Mohammad Daud Laghmani as new governor of Faryab, a post that was run by Naqibulalh Fayiq since 2018. 
The protests in Faryab are underway for the last seven days. On Friday, they decided to reopen hospitals and some essential government offices to provide service to the people. The new governor was introduced to his colleagues at an army base in the city of Maimana this week as the governor’s compound still remains closed due to protests. 
Junbish members said more protests were being organized in multiple provinces on Saturday.
“Don’t test our patience. We will stain these roads with our blood if needed,” said Amanullah, a protestor. 
 “Our message to the government is that this issue should be resolved soon to avoid any possible crisis,” an MP from Faryab, Hashmatullah Arman, said. 
A member of the National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan said that Dostum has recommended Murad Ali Murad, the former deputy chief of army staff, to be appointed as the new governor of Faryab, but the government has reportedly rejected the offer. 
 “The governor must be given the chance to prove himself because he knows the administrative affairs of the provinces,” said Dawa Khan Menapal, the head of the government’s media and information center. 
A former mujahedeen leader Mohammad Ismail Khan called the move a “big mistake” by the government. 
“When a person is appointed in a province, it should not be done in a way that provokes people’s anger or protest in the north,” Khan said.

Supreme State Council Key to Boost Peace Efforts: Ismail Khan
","
Mohammad Ismail Khan, a former mujahedeen leader and former minister of energy and water, on Friday said that the establishment of the Supreme State Council is important for accelerating the peace process and that the final list for members of the body will be announced Monday.
“If consensus is achieved, of course, the Taliban will also accept it to enter into dialogue with such people,” Ismail Khan said. “At the same time, the knowledge of these people (members of state council) can be a guiding principle for the government.”
Meanwhile, President Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the High Council for National Reconciliation in an interview with the Washington Post have said that the Taliban hasn’t been serious about engaging in the peace process and that the group still maintains ties with al Qaeda.
The two leaders said that the Taliban will not win militarily.
“Our priority is to make peace. If the Taliban insists on a violent takeover, they will face not just the Afghan security and defense forces, but also the Afghan people. People don’t want the Taliban. Ask people who have experienced their rule,” Ghani said as quoted by the Washington Post.
He said that Afghan political leaders in the Republic side are united in their position against the Taliban.
Ghani said that the Taliban is increasing violence everywhere.
“They are assassinating and targeting civilian actors. They’ve grown up outside normal families in madrassas in the absence of women, so women have been construed as a threat to them,” he said in the interview.
Abdullah, meanwhile, cast on the Taliban’s intention for peace.
“So far, the Taliban has not been serious in their negotiations,” Abdullah said as quoted by the Washington Post.
The deputy head of the reconciliation council, Assadullah Saadati, on Thursday said that discussions are underway between the government and political leaders about the structure and authorities of the Supreme State Council.
Saadati said the political leaders and parties want the Supreme State Council to be a powerful, decision-making body so it can decide on political and security matters, foreign policy and other areas of national interest.

Govt Prepares 18-Member List for Supreme State Council

The Afghan government has finalized the names of eighteen people as members of the Supreme State Council, according to a document a copy of which was seen by TOLOnews.           
There are 14 men and 4 women on the list.
Along with the names of President Ashraf Ghani, names of the head of High Council for National Reconciliation Abdullah Abdullah, former president Hamid Karzai, former jihadi leader Abdul Rab Rassoul Sayyaf, Hizb-e-Islami leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, former vice president Mohammad Karim Khalili, former foreign minister Salahuddin Rabbani and Fatima Gailani are on the 18-member list.
Other names are included Mohammad Mohaqiq, Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum, Ata Mohammad Noor, Mohammad Sarwar Danish, Mir Rahman Rahmani, Fazel Hadi Muslimyar, Hasina Safi, Fawzia Koofi, and Habiba Sarabi.
Politicians said that the key is that whether these individuals will have decision-making authority.
“These are the faces who have been in circulation over the past 20 years. There is no change in it. I don’t think these people will do something to help the government get on its own feet,” said Sayed Eshaq Gailani, the head of the National Solidarity Movement of Afghanistan.
Sources however said that some of the political leaders among them Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Marshal Dostum, and Salahuddin Rabbani have reservations on the structure of the council. Hekmatyar, for instance, wants a smaller number of people in the council. 
“If the Supreme State Council is not able to be a decision-maker body or if lacks the (executive) authority and there is a symbolic role for the political leaders, not only Mr. Marshal, but also other political leaders will not be there to participate,” said Mohammad Babur Farahmand, a top aide to Dostum.
Hekmatyar has reportedly insisted that the council should be smaller in structure. He has suggested that the council must have only eight members.
“If the quantity of the council members increases and authority is not given to it, then the existence and scientific concept for this council is rejected,” said Hafizurrahman Naqi, a member of Hizb-e-Islami.
“Those personalities who have a leverage on the country’s social, security, and political arenas should be members of this council,” said senator Mohammad Alam Ezedyar.
But, the Presidential Palace said that the list has not been finalized so far.
“Discussions are underway among the institutions. All necessary consultations will be shared and future steps will be taken based on these consultations,” said Latif Mahmoud, deputy spokesman to President Ghani.

Protests in Faryab Enter 8th Day Over Governor Appointment
","
Protests entered the eighth day in Faryab province on Saturday as hundreds of people rallied against the appointment of the new governor.
In the latest sign of escalating tensions, protestors on Saturday took to the streets in Maimana city in front of 209 Shaheen Army Corps where a week ago Ashraf Ghani-backed governor Mohammad Daud Laghmani started his job as new governor for the province.
Some of the protesters who had shroud-like outfits warned the army corps commander of severe public outrage if he does not ask the newly appointed governor to leave the province.
“Either our leader or shroud. We are ready to defend our leader until the last drop of our blood. We do not want the governor,” said Rohullah, a protester.
“Ghani wants to impose the evil that exists in his mind about Turks in Afghanistan,” said Mohammad Qasim, a protester.
“He (Ghani) must act based on the people's demand,” said Tahmina Shuja, a protester.
Meanwhile, sources close to the National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan, or Junbish-e-Milli, led by former vice president Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum said that a number of prominent political leaders including former president Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the High Council for Reconciliation, have entered as mediators to break the deadlock between the government and Marshal Dostum.
“Work is underway on the procedures or formation of the commission or the same public council. In the next step, the people of Faryab will conduct election to appoint their governor,” said Enayatullah Babur Farahmand, a top aide to Dostum.
“It is not like he (Dostum) seizes everything. The post of a marshal, share in the cabinet and membership in the senate. What has he done for the country?” said MP Nematullah Karyab. 
The tensions erupted in Faryab province when President Ghani appointed Laghmani as new governor for the province.

Afghanistan: Violence Displaces Over 8,000 Families
","
Over 8,000 families have been displaced in at least five provinces as fighting intensifies on multiple fronts between government forces and the Taliban, the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriations said on Saturday.
The families are faced with lack of shelter, access to health services, education and other facilities for a normal life, according to the displaced persons.
Baghlan, Helmand, Kunduz, Kandahar and Laghman are the five provinces where the families have been displaced. Heavy clashes are underway in the five provinces over the last few weeks, except for the three days of the ceasefire from May 13 to May 15.
“8,500 families have been displaced. Of the figure, 3,500 families have been displaced due to the fresh spat of violence,” said Sharifullah Shafiq, the head of the refugees and repatriations directorate in Baghlan. 
Heavy fighting is underway in three districts of Baghlan for the last two seven days. Taliban on Friday night launched new attacks on the three districts of Baghlan.
Parts of the center of Burka district in Baghlan fell to the Taliban. This led to intense fighting between the government forces and the Taliban.
Sources said that at least 10 security force members and 40 Taliban were either killed or wounded Friday night’s clashes in Baghlan-e-Markazi and Nahrin districts.
“A Taliban’s shadow governor named Qari Amrullah was killed in the war in Guzargah district,” Baghlan governor Mohammad Akbar Barikzai said,

Faryab Protesters 'Vote' for Governor, Would Accept Dostum's Pick

The protests in Faryab entered their ninth day on Sunday and demonstrators took a vote for a new governor of the northern province. 
Faryab is currently facing unrest because of President Ashraf Ghani's appointment of Mohammad Daud Laghmani, a non-resident, as a new governor. At least four names were reportedly put on the unofficial ballot, but protestors said they would also respect nominations made by Abdul Rashid Dostum to the Presidential Palace.   
The protests began nine days ago when the new governor was announced. He took office at an army base in the city of Maimana in Faryab last week. 
“If [the vote] is not accepted, the protests will continue with more power,” said Ehsanullah Qoanch, a protester. 
“We will accept anyone who is accepted by Marshal Dostum,” said Abdullah, a protester. 
The head of the Independent Directorate of Local Governance (IDLG), Shamim Khan Katawazi, said that some political figures have been in talks with Dostum for the last few days to end the protests. 
“Daud Laghmani is the governor of Faryab and he has started his work. So far, we have not made another decision,” Katawazi said. 
Some lawmakers said that the decision by the government to establish the new governor’s office at the army base will have negative consequences for the country’s army, as they should not be exploited in political disputes.  
“Military forces should not be used for political aims,” said former Faryab governor Mohammadullah Batash. 
Meanwhile, some Faryab residents said that a list of individuals is about to be sent to the Palace in a move that is being facilitated by former president Hamid Karzai and is intended to end the protests.

Fighting has reached the centers of both Baghlan province in the north and Laghman province in the east.  A district center in Laghman and some outposts fell to the Taliban in the last few days. The clashes in the two provinces have intensified after the three-day ceasefire on May 13 to May 15.
The center of Dawlatshah district in Laghman fell to the Taliban on Friday.
Laghman residents said the Taliban presence will expand in the province if the government does not provide the required attention. 
Figures indicate that at least 10 civilians and armed forces were killed due to fighting in the last 24 hours.
Afghan Army Chief Gen. Yasin Zia visited Laghman on Saturday along with other security officials, but sources from the province said a military base and two outposts were evacuated by security forces in the Ganjoon area on the outskirts of the city of Mehtarlam, the provincial center, and some forces have surrendered to the Taliban.
“The fighting is 200 meters from Mehtarlam city. So far, there is no plan by the government to clear Laghman’s districts,” said Sahib Noor Qaderi, a Laghman resident.
“One outpost in the Maidani area fell to militants. It collapsed after being under siege for three days,” said Gul Marai Laghmani, a senator.
In Baghlan, clashes are underway in four of its districts as well as on the outskirts of Pul-e-Khumri, the provincial center.
“Efforts are underway to ensure a ceasefire between the government and the opposition in Baghlan-e-Markazi (district),” said Nasim Mudabir, an MP from Baghlan. “In fact, if the central government or the local government proposes such a plan to the central government, there will be a disaster.”
According to figures by security agencies, clashes are underway in at least 20 provinces, including near their centers. The government launched operations to retake Charkh district in Logar, the Burka district in Baghlan, Dawlat Shah in Laghman, and Narkh and Jalrez in Maidan Wardak, but these operations have not succeeded in clearing out Taliban fighters.
“A proper and inclusive plan for security agencies is lacking. Sporadic fighting serves the enemy,” said Sayed Muqadam Amin, a military affairs analyst.
However, Defense Ministry spokesman Rohullah Ahmadzai said there is a proper plan by security and defense agencies to improve the security situation in the mentioned areas.
“Heavy losses have been inflicted on our enemy during our operations every 24 hours, but we advance with precision to avoid harm to civilians,” said Ahmadzai.
In Badakhshan province in northeastern Afghanistan six security force members were killed and four more were wounded in Taliban attack on an outpost in Darayem district. Moreover, two people, including a religious scholar, were killed in an attack by unidentified armed men in Parwan.
“The enemy is trying to disrupt our security. It has started its targeted attacks,” said Aminullah Shakoori, head of Parwan's Provincial Council.

Debate Continues Over Structure, Role of Supreme State Council
","
There has been no tangible progress made by political leaders and government officials in reaching an agreement on the Supreme State Council's structure, number of members, or authority--as either an advisory council or decision-making body--an official of the High Council for National Reconciliation said on Sunday.
According to a document seen by TOLOnews, an 18-person list has been prepared for membership of the Supreme State Council, but the Presidential Palace said it is not final so far. Some politicians, including Hizb-e-Islami leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, has called for less members, according to sources.
Enayatullah Babur Farahmand, the deputy head of the reconciliation council, referring to the list that was leaked to the media, said that inclusivity and proportionate religious and ethnic participation should be considered in the formation of the Supreme State Council.
“There are two big differences over the Supreme State Council. The first difference is over its authorities and the decision-making role of the council, and the second difference is on the structure and the number of the members of the Supreme State Council,” Farahmand said.
Some reports indicate that the president has sent some of his aides to consult with Hekmatyar, Salahuddin Rabbani and Hamid Karzai to discuss with them the finalization of the names of the council and the limits of its authorities.
“Some say that the number of the members of the council should be less, some say it should be more. Some say that if it is formed, its priority should be peace… I don’t think that they will achieve an agreement by tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,” former presidential adviser Shahzada Massoud said.
Meanwhile, Abdul Latif Pedram, the head of the National Congress Party, said at a news conference that all politicians who want to be a part of the Supreme State Council are responsible for the current situation in the country.
“Look at the members of the Supreme State Council. They are those who have had a major role in Afghanistan’s issues. They are accused of many issues, from misuse of authority, corruption, embezzlement to drug trafficking and others. Many of them have had a big role in the country’s situation over the last four decades,” Pedram said.
But the government said that consultations with political leaders on the council are underway.
“Out of the 18 people, 15 are either taking salaries from the Presidential Palace or they are paid by the Palace ... their security is ensured by the Palace. In fact, they are bound to Arg (the Presidential Palace),” said Torek Farhadi, a former presidential adviser.
According to a document seen by TOLOnews, there are 14 men and 4 women on the list. 
On the 18-member list are President Ashraf Ghani, the head of the High Council for National Reconciliation Abdullah Abdullah, former president Hamid Karzai, former jihadi leader Abdul Rab Rassoul Sayyaf, Hizb-e-Islami leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, former vice president Mohammad Karim Khalili, former foreign minister Salahuddin Rabbani and Fatima Gailani.

Noor Gul is 28 and has three children and was working as a highway driver to win bread for his family. 
“I have lost my hope. I have lost my both legs. I have three children to feed,” Noor Gul said. 
Noor Gul said that he has lost hope after he lost his legs. 
“How long will this war continue? How long people will people be maimed? There shouldn’t be violence anymore. They should make peace,” he said. 
Abdul Malik, an army soldier, said he lost his leg in a clash in Bala Murghab district in Badghis. He uses a prosthetic limb. He and other persons with disabilities visited an ICRC center that provides prosthetic limbs in Herat city this week. 
“We want peace. We hope that God will help us and bring peace to the country so that we don’t lose youth anymore,” Malik said.
“Peace is good. We are waiting for peace,” said Khalid, a soldier with a disability.

Aided by Afghan Govt, 40 Hindu, Sikh Afghans Return from India
","
Forty members of Afghanistan’s Hindu and Sikh community who left the country nine months ago returned from India on Sunday. 
They said they will remain in Afghanistan if the government provides them shelter and gives their children access to education. 
At least 200 Hindu and Sikh Afghans left the country and traveled to India last year after “threats and discrimination” against them in Afghanistan.
The 200 people who left were members of 20 families, and the move followed an attack on a Dharamshala, a place of worship, in Kabul in March 2020 in which 25 people were killed. 
Paramjit Kaur, who returned from India, said that besides being a caretaker for his three children, he also looks after his sister's four children whose father died in last year’s Daesh attack in Kabul.
“We thank the government for helping those who returned from India today,” Kaur said. 
The families said that they are living in a temple in Kabul due to lack of safety and shelter.
“My husband has died. I have no future,” said a returnee.
The government has provided some food and medicine as well as cash and says those who have returned will be provided shelter and their children will be provided access to education. 
“Shelter, schools and other basic needs will be addressed by the government,” said Ahmad Khan Nafe, head of the emergency operations center. 
The only representative of the Sikh community in Parliament, Narendra Singh Khalsa, said that out of 5,000 members of the Hindu and Sikh community in Afghanistan, only 900 have remained in the country. Others left over the last 18 years after their property was taken by land-grabbers in Kabul, Ghazni and Nangarhar, he said.
“I hope that we are supported by Mr. President who has directed the urban development ministry, and the education ministry,” Khalsa said.
Figures show that 48 Hindu and Sikh Afghans were killed and 33 more were injured due to violence in the country over the last four years.

Initial Agreement Made to Recall Faryab Governor to Kabul
","
The Afghan government, facing widespread protests, has agreed to recall newly-appointed governor Mohammad Daud Laghmani to Kabul and to authorize the deputy governor to lead the province, for the time being, a member of the National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan (Junbish-e-Milli) said.
Enayatullah Babur Farahmand said that the government has also agreed to keep the acting governor in place until the post is filled with a new pick agreed on by both Abdul Rashid Dostum and the Presidential Palace.
Farahmand said the protests will resume in Faryab and will be launched in Jawzjan and Sar-e-Pul provinces in the north on Tuesday if the decision is not implemented. 
“There is an agreement in principle that Mr. Daud Lahgmani should return to Kabul and protests in Faryab will stop until one of the candidates who is a resident of Faryab is approved as a governor,” Farahmand said. 
Meanwhile, protesters launched a protest in Faryab on Monday as well, but it was not as large as those over the last six days. 
“We will continue our protests and our protest camp in a civic way until our demands are accepted,” said Ata Mohammad, a protester. 
“The governor was appointed without consultation,” said Qudus Qlich, a protester. 
“If they do not respond, some people have the right to announce a decentralized government,” said Torsan, a resident of Faryab.  
The Independent Directorate of Local Governance, IDLG, announced on Monday evening that Abdul Muqim Rasikh, the deputy governor of Faryab, was appointed as acting governor of the province in response to the demands of Faryab residents.
The new governor was introduced last week to his office at an army base in the city of Maimana, which sparked reactions by analysts and politicians, who said that military institutions should not be manipulated for political purposes.

4 Years After Zanbaq Shooting, Victims’ Families Seek Justice
","
Some members of the Junbish-e-Rastakhez-e-Taghir or ""The Resurrection and Uprising for Change Movement"" at an event on Monday criticized the government for not following through on investigations into the shooting at Zanbaq Square in downtown Kabul four years ago that killed five people in May 2017. 
A string of violent events in 2017 began with a truck bomber detonating his explosives at Zanbaq Square, which has since been renamed Salim Ezedyar Square. Over 150 people were killed and 600 more were wounded. The explosion took place close to the Presidential Palace and in the heart of the diplomatic zone.  
Mass protests followed in the area but turned violent after security forces opened fire, killing at least five demonstrators.  
Ezedyar’s son, Mohammad Salim Ezedyar, was among those killed in the shooting.  
The next day, however, three suicide bombers targeted the funeral of Ezedyar’s son, and an additional 20 people were killed in back-to-back bombings at the burial ceremony. 
Ezedyar has now warned that if the government does not act and identify those behind the shooting, he will act and avenge his son’s death. 
Members of the movement said that an appellate court was expected to hold a session on Monday, but it was delayed once again for unknown reasons. 
“The case of our martyrs is still faced with ambiguity four years after the incident. This shows that some hands are involved in this case who don’t want the murderers of Afghanistan’s martyrs to be sent to justice,” said Kalimullah Hamsukhan, a member of the movement.  
“This case is still in court. No progress has been made on it,” said Shamsuddin Hamid, a member of the movement. 
The victims’ families said they are seeking a thorough investigation into the incident. 
“We have graduated from economy and law, but we have a master’s degree in jihad and resistance. If our elders would have allowed us, we would not have let this issue to continue for four years, but our elders want peace and want the problems to be solved peacefully,” said Abdul Bashir Almas, a member of the victim’s family. 
“So far, the government has not prosecuted any of those criminals,” said Zia-ul-Haq Naderi, brother of Ejazul-ul-Haq Naderi, who was killed in the incident. 
The Supreme Court said that the trial will be held next week and that the delay in the court session was due to problems in the activities by the relevant attorney.
“People are killed and then they vow prosecution. And then they don’t prosecute them. And then they talk about republic, governance and justice… If it happened, no one would have the courage to open fire on someone,” said Mohammad Alam Ezedyar, the deputy speaker of the Senate.

Doha: Negotiators Meet for Second Time in Renewed Talks
","
Some negotiators of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban held a meeting in Doha on Sunday--their latest since May 13--amid the stalled peace efforts that have shown no progress over the last two months after the announcement of US withdrawal from Afghanistan. 
Shaikh Abdul Hakim Haqqani, the head of the Taliban’s negotiating team, also attended the meeting, according to sources in Qatar. This follows his one-month consultation with Taliban leadership in Pakistan. He returned to Doha from Islamabad on Friday, sources said.
The Republic negotiators confirmed their meeting with the Taliban and said they discussed the resumption of the negotiations and the details of continuing the talks.
Republic negotiator Ghulam Farooq Majroh, who is in Afghanistan, said the meeting is a sign of improvement toward further peace negotiations.
“Brief discussions were made on the start of the negotiations and the details of the negotiations,” Majroh said.
The negotiations in Doha were stopped after US President Joe Biden announced an extension on the May 1st deadline for the full withdrawal of US and coalition forces from Afghanistan.
Also, the Taliban chose not to participate in a UN-led conference in Turkey.
“We have not left negotiations. We are here (in Doha). Some issues that happen in the political arena have no relation with the Islamic emirate of Afghanistan,” Taliban spokesman in Doha, Mohammad Naeem, said.
The two sides are opting to resume the negotiations as heavy fighting is ongoing between security forces and the Taliban in the last two weeks, letting up only for the three days of the EID ceasefire between May 13 and May 15.
“The ordinary people suffer the most sacrifice. What happened in Narkh? What happened in Jalrez? What is happening in other areas? The only way forward for both sides is to attend the intra-Afghan negotiations,” said Mohammad Amin Waqad, former deputy head of the High Peace Council.
Along with Doha, efforts are also reportedly underway in Pakistan to aid Afghan peace process.
Former president Hamid Karzai in an interview with Der Spiegel was asked about an upcoming conference in Pakistan where President Ashraf Ghani is expected to meet Taliban leader Mullah Hebatullah Akhundzada for the first time. Karzai said nothing is official yet, but he added “we would welcome such a proposal with the utmost interest.”
Karzai said, “At the same time, we have high hopes for the so-called Troika plus, a diplomatic initiative launched by Russia, which also includes China and the United States.”
Moreover, Russia’s Sputnik has reported that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said that the “monopolization” of power by the Taliban in Afghanistan is not acceptable for his country.

Fighting Persists in Laghman Despite Clearing Operations
","
The Defense Ministry said that Taliban attacks have been pushed back in Laghman province, but some provincial council members said that the fighting continues in the outskirts of Mehtarlam city as well as in Alisheng and Alingar districts.
Army chief Gen. Yasin Zia visited Laghman on Sunday and said that the situation was under control now that commando forces have begun operations.
Clashes meanwhile are underway in 11 provinces.
“The operations by Afghan forces led to the clearance of widespread areas on the outskirts of Mehtarlam and Alingar district” said Fawad Aman, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.
The Taliban captured the center of Dawlat Shah district and then attacked Alisheng and Alingar districts as well as Mehtarlam city, the center of Laghman. At one point they came close to the prison in Mehtarlam, which is almost 5 kilometers from the center of the city. Local sources said that “dozens” of outposts fell to the Taliban in the last five days.
“The situation is like the past in Laghman. There are no changes felt,” said Abdullah, a resident of Mehtarlam.
“Even outposts in Mehtarlam that are located on the way to Alisheng and Alingar districts have fallen,” said Gulzar Sangarwal, a member of Laghman's provincial council.
Some lawmakers said that the security situation in many provinces, including Laghman, requires thorough attention by the government.
“The situation in all provinces will become like Laghman if this condition continues. There is a lack of proper leadership,” said Bismullah Afghan, a member of the defense committee of Parliament.
Baghlan province in the north is also faced heavy fighting between the government forces and the Taliban over the last week. Some areas in Baghlan-e-Markazi district that were under Hizb-e-Islami fighters’ control, as well as the Pul-e-Khumri – Kunduz highway, have fallen to the Taliban and at least 10 security force members have been either killed or wounded in the clashes in the last 24 hours, according to local sources.
“There are the most the incompetent officials in Baghlan and they have never been able to ensure a good situation in Baghlan,” said Zarif Zarif, a Baghlan resident.
“Retreating is concerning whether it is tactical or not because we should not lose more territory and hand it to the Talibs,” said Zia Yaftali, an MP from Badakhshan.
The Ministry of Defense said that at least 140 Taliban were killed and 75 more were wounded in counterattack operations by Afghan forces in Nangarhar, Zabul, Kandahar, Herat, Badghis, Balkh, Faryab, Jawzjan, Sar-e-Pul, Baghlan, Kapisa and Kabul provinces in the last 24 hours.
The Taliban has rejected these figures provided by the ministry.
The recent clashes in Baghlan have displaced thousands of families in the province, according to local officials.

Supreme State Council to Have Decision-Making Authority: Aide
","
The Supreme State Council, which the government and political leaders have been working to finalize for the last few weeks, will have the authority to make decisions and provide advice on peace, war and the country’s foreign relations, a senior presidential adviser confirmed on Monday. 
Akram Khpulwak, President Ashraf Ghani’s political adviser and the deputy head of the High Council for National Reconciliation, said that discussions on the number of members and the structure of the Supreme State Council have been finalized, but talks are underway to decide the date of its first meeting.
Khpulwak said that the number of the council members might be at least 20 people and that the council will have a secretariate as well.
Khpulwak said that efforts are underway to hold the first session of the council in the near future.
“Consultations have been completed. The list has been finalized. And, work is underway on the second part, which is the agenda and procedures for meetings,” he told TOLOnews on Monday.
There were some differences on the details of the authorities of the council, but Khpulwak said that the council will not interfere in governance and legal issues but will work on peace and war matters as well as Afghanistan’s international relations. 
“There will be both consultations and discussions to make a shared decision under the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and then the implementation of the decisions will fall to relevant government institutions,” Khpulwak added. 
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of Hizb-e-Islami, and Salahuddin Rabbani, the head of the main faction of Jamiat-e-Islami, said they have differences on the details of the formation and the authorities of the council. 
“This council includes the president and leaders of important parties of the country--the parties that have an impact on war and peace. Their number cannot be more than eight,” said Humayun Jarir, a member of the leadership council of Hizb-e-Islami led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.
According to a document seen by TOLOnews, an 18-person list has been prepared for the membership of the Supreme State Council, but the Presidential Palace said it is not final so far. However, sources familiar with the matter said that besides Hasina Safi and Fatima Gailani, three more women will have membership on the council.
“The Supreme State Council or any other council will not be effective unless they have executive authority within the formation of the government,” said Habib-ur-Rahman Pedram, an MP from Herat.
“They are those who plunged Kabul into chaos. We urge them to name it the ""council of the state conspiracy,"" not the Supreme State Council,” said Belqis Roshan, an MP from Farah.
The council was supposed to be formed simultaneously with the High Council for National Reconciliation when Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah signed a political agreement last year. But efforts to form the council have been expedited over the last months. As part of these efforts, President Ghani has met with a number of politicians over the last few weeks.

Australia will close its embassy in Afghanistan within days as international troops have started to leave the country. 
Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials will instead visit Afghanistan from other residential posts in the region, according to The Canberra Times.

""This form of diplomatic representation is common practice around the world. It does not alter our commitment to Afghanistan or its people,"" he said.
Quoted by The Canberra Times, Morrison said the departure of Australian and allied forces over the next few months brought with it an increasingly uncertain security environment. 
""The government has been advised that security arrangements could not be provided to support our ongoing diplomatic presence,"" he said.
The embassy in Kabul will close on Friday, May 28. 
Australia has around 80 troops in Afghanistan who will leave the country by September. 
""We remain committed to supporting a just, durable and resilient peace arrangement that is led and owned by Afghanistan, and will bring stability and prosperity to the Afghan people,"" Australian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Pentagon: US Not 'Walking Away' From Region
","
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at a news conference with Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas on Tuesday said that NATO remains committed to its partnership with Afghanistan.
“We will continue to help the Afghan people and contribute to the peace efforts, including with continued training and funding of the Afghan security forces,” Stoltenberg said.
As the US military carries out President Joe Biden’s order to withdraw all American troops from Afghanistan by September, the Pentagon insists the US commitment to the region is not wavering.
“Just because we are removing our troops and ending our military mission in Afghanistan doesn't mean that we're walking away from the region,” Pentagon Spokesman John Kirby told reporters Monday.
“Nothing could be further from the truth,” he said.
According to an AP report, last week Gen. Frank McKenzie, the commander of US Central Command, said negotiations with Afghanistan's neighbors for overflight rights and troop basing are “moving forward” but will take time.
On Monday, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with Pakistan's chief of Army staff, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa.  The Pentagon didn't get specific about what the two military leaders discussed, other than to say they talked about ""shared regional interests and objectives.""
“During the call, Secretary Austin reiterated his appreciation for Pakistan’s support for Afghanistan Peace Negotiations and expressed his desire to continue to build on the US – Pakistan bilateral relationship,” the Defense Department said.
Commanders have said they will monitor threats from “over the horizon,” to ensure that terrorists cannot again use Afghanistan as a base to launch attacks against the US. But they have acknowledged that the US does not yet have any agreements for basing or overflights from any of the neighboring countries.
“There’s still going to be a robust United States presence in the Middle East, in the Central Command area of responsibility,” Kirby told reporters.
“There’s absolutely going to be no diminution of our commitment to our allies and partners in the region,” he said.
The US and coalition forces started withdrawing from the country on May 1. Some bases have been handed over to Afghan forces. US forces have started scrapping equipment that can neither be repaired or handed over to Afghan forces in its current state. The scrapping of vehicles and other equipment is taking place at the country’s largest air base, the Bagram Airfield.

Security Agencies: ANDSF Fighting Taliban in 104 Districts
","
The Afghan National Security and Defense Forces (ANDSF) are currently fighting the Taliban in 104 provinces, the Afghan security agencies said on Tuesday, noting a 7 percent increase compared to the same period last year.
Reflecting on the numbers of Taliban attacks across the country, Ahmad Zia Saraj, the head of the Afghan intelligence agency—the National Directorate of Security (NDS)--said that the militant group has launched 3,500 attacks since the start of the year. 
Hayatullah Hayat, the acting minister of interior, said that the current war in Afghanistan is part of a propaganda effort of regional players, and stated that the Afghan National Police (ANP) is determined to support the ANA in repelling Taliban attacks.
On Tuesday, Afghanistan’s Meshrano Jirga—the upper house of Parliament--summoned the heads of Afghanistan’s security agencies to inquire about the security situation in the country.
Senators expressed surprise over the situation in some provincial capitals.
“There is a problem in the policy-making, there are management issues and nepotism and political issues facing the country’s security and defense forces which are creating major problems for us,” said Mohammad Alam Ezedyar, the deputy head of the Meshrano Jirga.
“The Taliban made their way very easily to the prison in Baghlan, they also reached Helmand and Baghlan--the head of NDS is here, we should have preemptive measures,” said senator Rahmatullah Achakzai.
“Why haven't you taken these measures before? Why don’t you have a proper plan against the enemies?” asked Senator Mualim Lalagul.
“The war has increased during the spring and everyone knows about it, our assessments indicate that there is a seven percent increase in the Taliban’s war,” said Hayatullah Hayat, the acting Minister of Interior.
“Your security and defense forces are very determined and prepared, the enemy has suffered massive casualties and they do not have more strength,” said Ahmad Zia Saraj, the head of NDS.
“Regional intelligence and our enemies are spreading propaganda suggesting that parts here and there in Afghanistan are collapsing; this calculation is totally wrong,” said Hayatullah Hayat.
“Nothing has changed in Pakistan’s intentions, so what is our duty? We should settle our internal problems. We must empower ourselves and this will prevent Pakistan’s interference,” said Ahmad Zia Saraj, the head of the NDS.
Acting Minister of Interior Hayatullah Hayat meanwhile said that regional intelligence agencies are behind the current war in Afghanistan, and he confirmed his ministry’s commitment to supporting the Afghan army in the fight against the militants.
“What were the factors that led to the collapse of checkpoints in Laghman? Why did you (security agencies) not provide support to the soldiers while they were appealing for assistance during the fall of Dawlat Shah district,” said Gul Mari Laghmani, a member of the Afghanistan parliament.
“What were the reasons and the factors behind the sudden security turbulence in Laghman? Isn’t there good coordination between the local administration? Or the center is not focusing on the issue? You must know about it,” said Mir Hatam Tarahkhel.
According to the local officials in Baghlan, recent battles have left 15,000 people homeless in Baghlan province.
“Over 15,000 families have been displaced and this is a large number, and the figures are increasing,” said Sharifullah Shafaq, the head of Baghlan's migration department.
“Baghlan and Laghman are both facing security threats, there are some other factors behind the security challenges, we are closely working on the issue; until now we have managed to prevent the conspiracy,” said Hayatullah Hayat, the acting Minister of Interior, referring to proxy interests behind the fighting. 
“There was a bombardment. I live around this clinic, which is destroyed now, nothing is left for us,” said Sher Azam, a resident of Baghlan-e-Markazi district.
“We evacuated and left all our belongings behind, all the people become displaced,” said Mohammad Ishaq, a resident of Baghlan.
Last month the Afghan Ministry of Refugees and Repatriations said that the two months of war had displaced over 8,000 families in northern Afghanistan.
Laghman, Kunduz, Baghlan, Helmand and Kandahar have all recently witnessed battles between the Afghan security forces and the Taliban.
Saraj meanwhile criticized Pakistan’s continued interference in Afghanistan’s affairs and called on the Afghan people to mobilize in order to face the country's current challenges.
In recent weeks the Taliban has launched major offensives in at least five districts across various provinces and seized control.

Pakistan May Host Meeting on Afghan Peace: Sources
","
Pakistan is likely to host a conference on Afghanistan’s peace, and efforts are being made to hold the event at a high level between the Afghan government and the Taliban, sources from the Presidential Palace and the High Council for National Reconciliation said. 
The Taliban said they are not aware of any conference. 
In Doha, two meetings have been held within the last two weeks between negotiators from both sides. It was agreed that the meetings must continue, negotiators told TOLOnews.
Palace and HCNR sources said that the potential Pakistan conference has not been finalized, but both sides have held discussions over it. 
“Pakistanis say that one request of the Afghan officials was for Pakistan to organize a meeting with them and the Taliban leadership, but it has not happened so far, and now, too, I don’t think that it will be possible in the near future,” said Tahir Khan, a Pakistani journalist. 
The meeting on Afghan peace was considered after Pakistan Amy Chief Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa’s trip to Kabul where he met with President Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah. The meeting is seen as important to take the Taliban toward a political agreement. 
“During the trips made by Pakistani officials to Afghanistan, we witnessed what is apparently a positive change to end the war and ensure peace in Afghanistan in Pakistan’s policy (toward Afghanistan),” said Enayatullah Babur Farahmand, the deputy head of the reconciliation council. 
But the Taliban negotiating team in Doha did not confirm attempts to hold the meeting. 
“How possible is this? I think that the Taliban will not accept. The Taliban wants to negotiate with the Afghan side in Qatar, Istanbul or in another place--without Pakistan,” university lecturer Faizullah Zaland said. 
Efforts are also underway to hold a successful conference in Turkey on Afghanistan’s peace.  
“Turkey wants to see the peace process move forward, so do we, so does the world, so does US, and the Afghan people,” Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said in an interview with TRT World on Monday. 
Amid the start of the withdrawal of US and coalition forces from Afghanistan, parts of the country have witnessed heavy clashes between government forces and the Taliban. This has left the people with concerns over the country’s future once all foreign troops have left Afghanistan. 
However, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at a news conference with Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas on Tuesday said that NATO remains committed to its partnership with Afghanistan.

Appointed Governor Returns to Kabul, Protests Continue in Faryab
","
Mohammad Daud Laghmani, the recently appointed governor of Faryab province, returned to Kabul today after staying a week in an army base in Maimana city of Faryab province, according to the Independent Directorate of Local Governance (IDLG).
Following ten days of protests over the appointment of Daud Laghmani as Faryab's governor by the central government, on Monday night the IDLG announced that Abdul Muqim Rasikh, the acting deputy governor of Faryab province, will be the acting governor of the province until the appointment of a new governor.  
But the protesters today still marched on the streets of Maimana, saying they would not stop their demonstrations until a new governor is appointed.
Ehsanullah Qawanch, a protester in Faryab, said: ""We respect Mr. Rasikh, but the people’s real demand is for the appointment of a new governor."" 
""The protests will continue until the new governor is introduced. The new governor’s appointment should be selected by the people of Faryab,” said Sayed Naeem, a protestor.
Protesters say that although the government has asked Daoud Laghmani to return to Kabul, they are waiting for Marshal Dostum's order to end their protests.
Junbish-e-Mili Afghanistan (The National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan), a political party led by Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum, said that the government will nominate a governor for the Faryab province from a list that Dostum submitted to the government earlier. However, the government did not confirm this.
Senator Rahela Dostum stated: ""Our demand to the President is--for the sake of national consensus--focus on unity and solidarity, for which there is a critical need now more than ever. He should not let the distance be created between the people and the government."" 
The government institutions in Faryab have been closed for the last 11 days. 
Several senators said that the government should not make such a political decision in the current chaotic situation that provokes reactions from the people.
MP Bismillah Jan Mohammad said: ""The situation is sensitive. The government should not make changes without consulting the people."" 
Although Hamid Karzai, the former president of Afghanistan, is mediating between the government and the Junbish-e-Mili party to resolve disagreements, it is not clear whether the government will agree to appoint one of the proposed nominees by Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum as the new governor of Faryab province.
About a month ago, Dawood Laghmani was officially announced as a replacement to Naqibullah Fayeq, the previous governor of Faryab, but eight days ago, Mr. Laghmani started his job as the Fayab governor in an army base in the province, which triggered reactions from the Junbish members and supporters.

Hekmatyar Will Not Join Supreme State Council: Aide
","
A member of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hizb-e-Islami party, Humayoun Jarir, on Tuesday blamed the Presidential Palace for not delivering on its promise about the structure and the authority of the Supreme State Council and said that Hekmatyar will not participate in the Supreme State Council as a member.
“The Arg (Presidential Palace) has not followed through on the promises it made in the trilateral meeting with Mr. Hekmatyar and Mr. Karzai,” said Jarir.
“We believe that the government is forming the council it wants with its supporters among the members. The Hizb-e-Islami party has never been in the government and will not participate in the Supreme State Council,” said Jarir.
Meanwhile, a member of Jamiat-e-Islami (Salahuddin Rabbani faction) has also raised concerns about the authority and structure of the council.
“The efforts that have been made recently were manipulated for personal agendas and political ambitions. Jamiat-e-Islami believes that any council that is formed--its areas of work and authorities must be specified,” said a member of Jamiat-e-Islami (Salahuddin Rabbani faction).
However, the National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan led by Marshal Dostum has said that the government has made some commitments to them about the structure and authorities of the council.
“If the government remains committed on what it had pledged before about the structure, which was also leaked in media, and considers balance in the structure, of course, we will support it. If it does not happen, then it will remain incomplete,” said Ehsan Nairo, a spokesman to Marshal Dostum.
According to a document seen by TOLOnews this week, an 18-person list has been prepared for the membership of the Supreme State Council, but the Presidential Palace said it is not final so far. However, sources familiar with the matter said that besides Hasina Safi and Fatima Gailani, three more women will have membership on the council.
The council was supposed to be formed simultaneously with the High Council for National Reconciliation when Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah signed a political agreement last year. But efforts to form the council have been expedited over the last months. As part of these efforts, President Ghani has met with a number of politicians over the last few weeks.

Afghanistan Pullout 'Nearly One-Quarter Complete': Pentagon
","
US Central Command announced on Tuesday that they estimate the US withdrawal from Afghanistan to be somewhere between 16% and 25% complete. President Joe Biden announced earlier that the complete withdrawal would finish by September 11,  2021.
Approximately 160 C-17 loads of materiel and equipment have left Afghanistan, the US Department of Defense (DoD) reported, and more than 10,000 pieces of military equipment have been turned over to the Defense Logistics Agency.  
US-controlled installations in Afghanistan are also being returned to the Afghan Defense Ministry, and so far five installations have been handed back, said the DoD. 
After 20 years, the US is leaving Afghanistan because the mission there is complete, said Pentagon Press Secretary John F. Kirby during a press briefing on Tuesday at the Pentagon.  
""The president has been very clear that our troops accomplished the mission for which they were sent to Afghanistan,"" Kirby said. ""That was to prevent the country from being used as a safe haven for terrorist attacks on our homeland, and there hasn't been another attack on the homeland emanating from Afghanistan since 9/11. So the president believes the mission has been completed.""  
Kirby said that the relationship with Afghan security forces will continue. The US will create a ""new bilateral relationship with Afghanistan across the government: diplomatically, economically, politically and certainly from a security perspective,"" Kirby said. ""Our relationship with Afghan National Defense and Security Forces will continue, but it will continue in a different way.""  
However, US involvement in the region is not going to end entirely, according to Kirby, who said the US will be ready to meet threats by strengthening existing ""over-the-horizon"" capabilities there and growing new ones.  
Kirby said the US already has some over-the-horizon capacity in the region with forces already stationed there and long-range capabilities that are outside the region.  
According to an AP report, last week Gen. Frank McKenzie, the commander of US Central Command, said negotiations with Afghanistan's neighbors for overflight rights and troop basing are “moving forward” but will take time. 
On Monday, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with Pakistan's chief of Army staff, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa.  The Pentagon didn't get specific about what the two military leaders discussed, other than to say they talked about ""shared regional interests and objectives."" 
“During the call, Secretary Austin reiterated his appreciation for Pakistan’s support for Afghanistan Peace Negotiations and expressed his desire to continue to build on the US – Pakistan bilateral relationship,” the Defense Department said. 
Commanders have said they will monitor threats from “over the horizon,” to ensure that terrorists cannot again use Afghanistan as a base to launch attacks against the US. But they have acknowledged that the US does not yet have any agreements for basing or overflights from any of the neighboring countries. 
“There’s still going to be a robust United States presence in the Middle East, in the Central Command area of responsibility,” Kirby told reporters. 
“There’s absolutely going to be no diminution of our commitment to our allies and partners in the region,” he said. 
Reacting to reports about the US’s possible intention to keep its presence in the region after leaving Afghanistan, the Taliban in a statement on Wednesday asked neighboring countries to not provide such an opportunity.
The Taliban said they have pledged that Afghanistan will not be used as a threat against others; therefore, they call on countries in the region to avoid the use of their territories against Afghanistan. 
The Taliban warned of “future consequences” for those countries that allow “foreign bases” on their territories. 
The US and coalition forces started withdrawing from the country on May 1. Some bases have been handed over to Afghan forces. US forces have started scrapping equipment that can neither be repaired or handed over to Afghan forces in its current state. The scrapping of vehicles and other equipment is taking place at the country’s largest air base, the Bagram Airfield.

Taliban Warns Neighbor Countries Against Hosting US Bases
","
Reacting to reports that the US was considering the establishment of military bases in Afghanistan’s neighboring countries, the Taliban in a statement on Tuesday warned neighboring countries against such a move, saying that the Taliban will ""not remain silent"" and ""will fulfill its religious and historical responsibilities in the same way as it has performed throughout history.""
The statement read: ""As we have repeatedly assured others that our soil will not be used against the security of others, we are similarly urging others not to use their soil and airspace against our country. If such a step is taken, then the responsibility for all the misfortunes and difficulties lies upon those who commit such mistakes.""
""God forbid, if such a step is taken once again, it will be a great historic mistake and disgrace that shall forever be inscribed as a dark stain in history,"" said the statement.
The Taliban said that if Afghanistan’s neighboring countries allow foreign bases, there would be future consequences.
Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi rejected reports that Pakistan was building military bases on its soil amid claims that the US was considering bases in Balochistan province.
“When a member of the foreign relations committee of the US Senate talks about things that Pakistan will provide them-- like air access and ground facilities--it means there is something going on behind the scenes. Although Pakistan has rejected this, it looks like a necessary option to promote friendly relations between Pakistan, the US and Afghanistan,” said Pakistani journalist Tahir Khan.
Previously, AFP quoted a US defense official saying that Pakistan had allowed the US to use Pakistan’s air space in support of US forces deployed in Afghanistan. 
“A beggar does not have the right to choose, because the owner of the house has the ability to decide. Pakistan does not have the right to choose,” said military analyst Atiqullah Amerkhel.
Fighting in Afghanistan has surged and peace talks in Doha halted following President Joe Biden's announcement that he was extending the US pullout deadline to September 11, 2021. However, there have recently been two meetings between negotiators. 
Taliban sources said that the group will attend the proposed US-led conference on Afghanistan in Turkey with three preconditions:
“The conference must be short, the agenda should not include decision-making on critical issues, and the Taliban delegation should be low level, a senior Taliban leader told VOA Tuesday. 
“Our leadership has proposed that the Istanbul meeting should not be longer than three days,” said the leader who did not want to be identified as he is not allowed to speak on the record.
“They (Taliban) come up with numerous reasons to escape from engaging in an effective dialogue,” said Mohammad Amiri, a deputy spokesman for President Ashraf Ghani.
This comes two days after the Russian special envoy for Afghanistan Zamir Kaboluv in an interview with Sputnik rejected speculations that the US was considering military bases in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.
President Joe Biden announced earlier that the complete withdrawal would be finished by September 11,  2021.
US Central Command announced on Tuesday that they estimate the US withdrawal from Afghanistan to be somewhere between 16% and 25% complete.

MPs Blame Govt for Allowing '$8M Per Day' Embezzlement in Customs
","
A number of lawmakers in Afghanistan's Wolesi Jirga—the lower house of Parliament--on Wednesday blamed the Afghan government for what they described as systematic corruption and the embezzlement of the national assets of the country.
They said that a few government officials are behind all the corruption and embezzlement cases.
The lawmakers also lashed out at the Ministry of Finance (MoF) for not disclosing the name of those accused of embezzling $8 million from the customs on a daily basis.
MPs also criticized the government for ignoring the decisions of the Parliament on the issue of caretakers.
They said that the government is violating the Constitution in terms of appointments.
But the Presidential Palace has rejected the allegations.
“The caretaker issue should be resolved; currently the private sector is on the run,” said MP Ghulam Farooq Nazari.
“The government has consecutively violated the Constitution, the ministers who were sacked by us continue their work,” said MP Waqif Hakimi.
“I recommend that we close the door of the house for one week in protest,” said MP Abdul Baseer Osmani.
“Who is this thief who steals 3 billion dollars annually, or perhaps it is about six or nine billion?” said MP Khaled Assad.
“The acting minister of finance is not disclosing the names of who are collaborating with the corrupt people,” said MP Nasim Mudabir.
“Combating corruption within the framework of the prevailing laws and anti-corruption strategy is one of the important priorities of the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan,”  said Latif Mahmoud, deputy presidential spokesman.
The Afghan acting minister of finance last week did not deny claims by lawmakers in Parliament who alleged that $8 million worth of revenue is being embezzled from customs on a daily basis, but he did say there are reports of corruption involving governors, police commanders, and employees of the Ministry of Finance as well as ordinary citizens.

MPs Critical of Govt’s Security Policy in Laghman
","
MPs from Baghlan on Wednesday said that the fragile security situation in Laghman has not improved despite military reinforcements being sent to the region to repel Taliban threats and restore normalcy to insecure areas. 
Meanwhile, members of Parliament’s internal security commission said that the fighting has reached the suburbs of the provincial capital Mehtarlam.
Some MPs meanwhile said that some parts of Jalga district in Laghman have fallen to the Taliban. They said that it is also a strategic route to supply the government forces with weapons and other necessary equipment in Nahrain district.
This comes a week after the Taliban launched attacks on some parts of Laghman including Alishing, Alingar and Mehtarlam districts.
“The central prison is now the frontline of fighting in Laghman,” said Laghman MP Mohammad Rafi Mamozai.
“The security forces have cleared Mehtarlam City from the presence of Taliban, operations are underway in Alishing and Alingar, we are looking to clear the remaining areas too, the only reasons the clearance operations are delayed is the presence of the Taliban in people’s homes,” said Rahmatullah Yarmal, governor of Laghman.
“Our security forces are planning to evacuate those checkpoints that were permanently under siege and relocate them around the cities and main highways--well it is a right decision, but their place will be filled by the Taliban, this is the mistake that was carried out during the time of President Najibullah,” said military analyst Saleh Mohammad Registani.
“Any tactical retreat that is carried out against military principles should be assessed in line with the intelligence and operational principles,” said Farid Ahmadi, the former commander of Special Operations Forces.
The Afghan National Security and Defense Forces (ANDSF) are currently fighting the Taliban in 104 provinces, the Afghan security agencies said on Tuesday, noting a 7 percent increase compared to the same period last year.
Reflecting on the numbers of Taliban attacks across the country, Ahmad Zia Saraj, the head of the Afghan intelligence agency—the National Directorate of Security (NDS)--said that the militant group has launched 3,500 attacks since the start of the year.
Hayatullah Hayat, the acting minister of interior, said that the current war in Afghanistan is part of a propaganda effort of regional players, and stated that the Afghan National Police (ANP) is determined to support the ANA in repelling Taliban attacks.
On Tuesday, Afghanistan’s Meshrano Jirga—the upper house of Parliament--summoned the heads of Afghanistan’s security agencies to inquire about the security situation in the country.
Senators expressed surprise over the situation in some provincial capitals.
“There is a problem in the policy-making, there are management issues and nepotism and political issues facing the country’s security and defense forces which are creating major problems for us,” said Mohammad Alam Ezedyar, the deputy head of the Meshrano Jirga.
Last month the Afghan Ministry of Refugees and Repatriations said that the two months of war had displaced over 8,000 families in northern Afghanistan.
Laghman, Kunduz, Baghlan, Helmand and Kandahar have all recently witnessed battles between the Afghan security forces and the Taliban.
Saraj meanwhile criticized Pakistan’s continued interference in Afghanistan’s affairs and called on the Afghan people to mobilize in order to face the country's current challenges.
In recent weeks the Taliban has launched major offensives in at least five districts across various provinces and seized control.

The Taliban have so far not commented on the issue.
This comes as the US continues withdrawing troops from Afghanistan since May 1 as ordered by President Joe Biden.
“The airport is key. Without it there is no way in and out safely so everyone would leave. If that happens Kabul crumbles,” the Sun reported quoting a source.
“The Americans have always struggled for their security wherever they were, they do not have trust in other forces,” said MP Shinkai Karokhel.
“I will explore all options, whether from inside the country or outside it, to continue to support Afghan forces,” said British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace as quoted in The Sun.
Meanwhile, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg reiterated the alliance’s commitment to Afghanistan.
“We also addressed Afghanistan where the drawdown of our troops continues in a coordinated way. At the same time, NATO remains committed to our enduring partnership with Afghanistan. This includes continuous training and financial sustainment of the Afghan forces and supporting all efforts towards sustainable peace,” said NATO Secretary-General Jen Stoltenberg. 
This comes a day after Afghan National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib in a phone call with his American counterpart Jake Sullivan discussed the future.

AP: NATO Chief Says Afghan Forces Can Cope Alone

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says the alliance has helped provide security in Afghanistan for almost two decades, but the Afghan government and the Afghan forces are strong enough to stand on their own feet in absence of international troops’ support.
The US and coalition forces started their withdrawal on May 1. So far, nearly one-quarter of the withdrawal has been completed, according to the Pentagon.
“I think that the Afghans, they also realize that we have been there now for 20 years and we have invested heavily in blood and treasure in Afghanistan,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in an interview with The Associated Press.
“Afghanistan has come a long way, both when it comes to building strong, capable security forces, but also when it comes to social and economic progress. At some stage, it has to be the Afghans that take full responsibility for peace and stability in their own country,” Stoltenberg said in the interview.
The announcement of the withdrawal has been followed by concerns about the country’s political future. But there have been some assurances by Afghan leaders about the management of the situation with their main focus on unity among the people.
He said that NATO allies will continue to support Afghanistan through civilian experts who will help to advise government ministries, by funding the security forces and with support for slow-moving peace talks between Kabul and the Taliban. 
Stoltenberg, quoted by AP, said that NATO is also “looking into the possibility of providing some training out of country for the Afghan security forces, but no final decision has been taken.”
Violence has remained high in the country despite a three-day ceasefire from May 13 to May 15. The Defense Ministry during this week reported conflicts in at least over 12 provinces on a daily basis. 
The situation in Laghman and Baghlan in the east and north of Afghanistan has been tense over the last two weeks following Taliban attacks on Afghan forces outposts on multiple fronts. 
But in the political arena, efforts are underway to former a state council that would mainly focus on decision-making issues and consultations on the ongoing peace efforts in the country.
The State Minister on Peace Affairs on Thursday said that most of the nation’s political leaders are ready to become members of the council and to help the government in the post-withdrawal scenario.

Taliban Accuses US of Seeking Regional Bases Post-Withdrawal
","
Taliban in a new statement has accused the United States of seeking a military presence in the region, “especially in Pakistan,” as part of its efforts to maintain surveillance in Afghanistan, warning that it will lead to “more bloodshed” in the country if it takes place.
The statement published on Friday says that the Doha agreement has been “repeatedly” violated by the US and that it has led to the continuation of violence in Afghanistan. The US has rejected claims on violation of the Doha agreement.
Taliban says that some media reports have said that the US will keep its presence along the Durand Line for surveillance using Pakistan’s territory and airspace. This will mean that the US will maintain its presence in Bagram and Shindand—bases in Afghanistan—and that if this happens, the Taliban “will continue their jihad” as in the past, the statement says.
The Taliban has asked Pakistan not to facilitate the continuation of “Afghanistan’s occupation;” otherwise, if it happened, it will be “a mistake” and a “big blunder” for Pakistan.
However, Pakistan has ruled out the possibility of allowing the US to operate a military base or conduct drone operations in Afghanistan from its soil. 
On May 26, Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told Pakistan’s Senate that there are no such arrangements with Washington, Islamabad's longtime ally in the so-called war against terrorism.
“Let this House and the Pakistani nation be a witness to my testimony that under Prime Minister Imran Khan, there will be no American base on Pakistani soil,” Qureshi said as quoted by Anadolu Agency.
The Pentagon this week insisted the US commitment to the region is not wavering.
“Just because we are removing our troops and ending our military mission in Afghanistan doesn’t mean that we’re walking away from the region,” Pentagon Spokesman John Kirby told reporters on May 24. “Nothing could be further from the truth,” he said.
According to an AP report, last week Gen. Frank McKenzie, the commander of US Central Command, said negotiations with Afghanistan’s neighbors for overflight rights and troop basing are “moving forward” but will take time.
On May 24, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with Pakistan's chief of Army staff, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa. The Pentagon didn’t provide further information about what the two military leaders discussed, other than to say they talked about “shared regional interests and objectives.”
“During the call, Secretary Austin reiterated his appreciation for Pakistan’s support for Afghanistan Peace Negotiations and expressed his desire to continue to build on the US – Pakistan bilateral relationship,” the Defense Department said.
Commanders have said they will monitor threats from “over the horizon,” to ensure that terrorists cannot again use Afghanistan as a base to launch attacks against the US. But they have acknowledged that the US does not yet have any agreements for basing or overflights from any of the neighboring countries.
“There’s still going to be a robust United States presence in the Middle East, in the Central Command area of responsibility,” Kirby said on May 24. “There’s absolutely going to be no diminution of our commitment to our allies and partners in the region.”
The US and coalition forces started withdrawing from the country on May 1. Some bases have been handed over to Afghan forces. US forces have started scrapping equipment that can neither be repaired nor handed over to Afghan forces in its current state. The scrapping of vehicles and other equipment is taking place at the country’s largest airbase, the Bagram Airfield.
The new statement by the Taliban comes days after their previous statement in which they did not name Pakistan but warned against any attempt to establish foreign bases in the region. 
US Central Command announced on Tuesday that they estimate the US withdrawal from Afghanistan to be somewhere between 16% and 25% complete.
Approximately 160 C-17 loads of material and equipment have left Afghanistan, the US Department of Defense (DoD) reported, and more than 10,000 pieces of military equipment have been turned over to the Defense Logistics Agency. 
US-controlled installations in Afghanistan are also being returned to the Afghan Defense Ministry, and so far, five installations have been handed back, said the Defense Department.

Political Leaders Warn Taliban against Push for Military Win
","
Two influential political leaders at an event in Kabul on Friday warned of “severe consequences” against the Taliban if the group continues violence with the hope to win militarily. They warned they are preparing for confrontation, but they keep their hope that the country will not enter another bloody war after US and coalition forces leave.  
Salahuddin Rabbani, the leader of the main faction of Jamiat-e-Islami, said today’s generation of Afghanistan is more eager than their previous generation when it comes to defending the country and its values against hostilities. He said the people are ready to safeguard the country’s hard-won gains of the last two decades as their “red line.” 
Rabbani said the Taliban should not miscalculate that the foreign troops' withdrawal will help them to win militarily. 
“The Taliban should know that the people of Afghanistan and the present generation believe in freedom and justice and they are determined than the past towards these components,” Rabbani said.  
He indirectly questioned President Ashraf Ghani’s policy towards Pakistan, saying that “wrong policies” by some people instead pushed Afghanistan towards isolation instead of isolating Islamabad in international stage. 
At the same event, Mohammad Mohaqiq, the leader of Hizb-e-Wahdat-e-Islami Afghanistan, also expressed his all-out support to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces in their campaign against insurgents, and said he is ready to fight against the Taliban when necessary. 
Both leaders expressed these remarks at a ceremony marking the 10th assassination anniversary of two prominent mujahideen commanders Gen. Daud Daud and Shah Jahan Noori. 
“Some elements claimed that they have isolated the country, and another has been isolated, but the reality is totally different from their perception. The unfortunate thing is that today Afghanistan has been isolated due to the wrong policies,” stated Rabbani, indirectly referring to President Ashraf Ghani’s claims in the past that he had isolated Pakistan. 
Mohaqiq called on the international community to save Afghanistan from becoming a sanctuary for international terrorism once again. 
“We firmly stand with the people, the government, the National Defense and Security Forces in support of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan,” Mohaqiq said.
Other speakers at the event stressed the need for a thorough investigation into the targeted killing of influential figures. 
“Regretfully, the situation is like the one in which people have to choose between bad and worse. People’s future shouldn’t move towards a misleading path,” said Mohammad Alam Ezedyar, the deputy speaker of the Senate, the Meshrano Jirga.  
“We are being killed one by one, but no voice is raised, no movement is taking shape and no decision is taken to investigate these cases. We are tired now,” said Mohib Noori, brother of a former mujahedeen commander. 
Violence has remained high in the country as the withdrawal of US and coalition forces is underway. Analysts argue that a full withdrawal will create serious flaws in the security arena for the Afghan forces. But Afghanistan’s allies have said that they will continue supporting the Afghan government and the security forces after their pullout. 
NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday said that the Alliance has helped provide security in Afghanistan for almost two decades, but the Afghan government and the Afghan forces are strong enough to stand on their own feet in absence of international troops’ support.

Victims’ Families Seek Thorough Probe into School Attack
","
Twenty days after multiple blasts near Sayed al-Shuhada High School in Kabul, victims’ families at an event on Friday said the government so far has not shared the results of its investigation; therefore, there is a need for a thorough probe into the incident.
The families warned that they will not send their children to school unless there are full-proof security measures by the government to protect the school from similar attacks in the future.
They also called on the Afghan government to identify organizers of the attack and renew its security policy for the west of Kabul. 
“Any school you attack will be more crowded and any tuition center you attack will emerge more vibrant,” said Abdullah Fazli, member of Afghanistan’s Shia Religious Scholars Council. 
“The government has not provided any response to us about who is behind the attack and why it happened,” said Mohammad Hakim, a victim’s family member. 
At least 90 people, most of them students, were killed and over 150 more were wounded in the attack that started with a car bomb explosion near the school and was followed by two more IED blasts in the same area. 
“I am wearing black to mourn the loss of my brother, but I don’t want to lose another brother,” said Habibullah, a family member of one of the victims. 
 “We want the school to reopen so that we do not miss our studies,” said Zahra, a student at Sayed al-Shuhada school.

Rabbani: Efforts to Form Supreme State Council ‘Symbolic’
","
The efforts made by the Presidential Palace to form the Supreme State Council will not help the fragile peace process as they are ""politically motivated and symbolic"" rather than being a game-changer, the head of Jamiat-e-Islami, Salahuddin Rabbani, said.
Speaking to TOLOnews, Rabbani said that a final decision is yet to be taken about whether Jamiat-e-Islami under his leadership will participate in the council, but he clarified that Jamiat’s position regarding the government has been “very clear.”
“Members of the council should have decision-making authority,” Rabbani said. “They shouldn’t be there only as symbols or remain absent when big decisions on major issues are made.”
Rabbani, who changed into a main critic of the incumbent government following the 2019 controversial elections, said they will not take part in the Supreme State Council unless the government comes up with solid guarantees about authorities and the position of the council.
“I believe that if we see their previous actions or if we analyze the history of the government of national unity and the situation that we had after 2019 elections and the agreement that put an end to the disputes, all these episodes indicate that they remained indifferent to what they had promised. Violations happened one after another and those as party to the disputes experienced only insults and humiliation, not anything else,” said Rabbani.
Meanwhile,  Mohammad Akram Khpolwak, a top aide to President Ghani, said that the Hizb-e-Islami party led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar has shared its perspective on the modality and nature of the council with the government. He said that the government is now awaiting a response from the Jamiat-e-Islami Afghanistan led by Salahuddin Rabbani.
“We are waiting to receive views from Mr. Rabbani, and we hope that they send it to us soon so that our elders can decide on the final suggestions regarding those matters,” said Khpolwak.
He said that the formation of the council “nearly completed.”
“It means all activities regarding the council have been completed and views from all sides will be shared with the president this week,” he said. “There will be agreement about authorities of the council. The president is expected to decide this week about when to convene the first meeting of the council.”
Khpolwak said that the council will have 21 members including four women.
Reports say that the names of Fatima Gailani and Haseena Safi have been finalized as female members of the council and discussions are underway about the appointment of more female members.

Key US Military Base in Kabul Handed Over to Afghan Forces
","
A key military base of US forces in downtown, the New Kabul Compound, also known as NKC, was handed over to the Ministry of Defense at a ceremony on Friday.
Fawad Aman, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry, said that at a ceremony on the occasion, US and NATO forces commander Gen. Scott Miller emphasized the international community's continued support to Afghan forces.
The withdrawal of the US and NATO forces from the country started on May 1.

The figures also show that the US had by last week officially handed over five facilities to the Ministry of Defense of Afghanistan. 
Pentagon officials have said that the US has completed up to 25% of the entire withdrawal process.

Biden Says US Forces Have Achieved Their ‘Purpose’ in Afghanistan
","
US President Joe Biden in a speech on Friday honored the sacrifice of combat veterans ahead of the planned withdrawal later this year from Afghanistan and said they have achieved their purpose in the country – which was “to prevent al Qaeda from using Afghanistan as a base from which to attack America in the future.
Addressing US service members in a hangar at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia, Biden said the US went to Afghanistan with a clear purpose: “to get the people who attacked us on 9/11 and to prevent al Qaeda from using Afghanistan as a base from which to attack America in the future. To achieve that purpose – you achieved that purpose.” 
“Year after year, deployment after deployment, American troops pursued the terrorist threat through some of the most unforgiving terrain on the planet,” Biden said.
“As we draw down, we’re also going to focus on the urgent work of rebuilding over-the-horizon capabilities that’ll allow us to take out al Qaeda if they return to Afghanistan but to focus on the threat that has metastasized,” Biden said.  
He said that the greatest threat and likelihood of attack from al Qaeda or Daesh is not going to be from Afghanistan; “it’s going to be from five other regions of the world that have significantly more presence of both al Qaeda and organizational structures, including ISIS.”
This comes as US Defense Department last week confirmed that American troops and their NATO allies intend to be out of Afghanistan by early to mid-July, months ahead of the deadline announced by President Biden. 
On Friday, a key military base of US forces in downtown, the New Kabul Compound, also known as NKC, was handed over to the Ministry Defense.

Pentagon 2022 Budget Request for ANDSF $3.3 Billion, Up 9.2%
","
The US Department of Defense has asked for $3.3 billion for the 2022 fiscal year budget in operational support to sustain the Afghan security forces, a 9.2% increase from 2021. 
Biden’s $715 billion Department of Defense budget includes a 2.7% pay raise for troops and shifts billions in spending from old systems to help pay to modernize the nuclear arsenal to deter China.
The defense spending request for fiscal 2022 that was sent to US Congress on Friday invests in troop readiness, space, the Pacific Deterrence Initiative aimed at countering China's military build-up in Asia and nuclear weapons technology, according to a report by Reuters.
Pentagon officials have said that the United States would still support Afghanistan through financial means, not boots on the grounds, according to a report by Defense One.
The US Army would get $173.0 billion under the Pentagon’s fiscal 2022 budget request, down from the $176.6 billion it received in the current fiscal year, according to its budget documents, Defense One reports.
According to the report, the US Army will see a $3.2 billion decrease in costs in operation and maintenance funds due to the Afghanistan and Iraq drawdowns.
If inflation stays at 4 percent, the report says, that would mean a real decrease of about 6 percent — a steeper real decline than in the overall defense budget request, which at $715 billion would decline about 3 percent in real terms from the current year.
Quoting senior defense officials, Defense One reports that Biden’s decision to withdraw from Afghanistan means the Navy and Air Force need more money and the Army less.
The withdrawal of the US and NATO forces from the country started on May 1. So far, according to figures provided by US Central Command, the Pentagon has retrograded the equivalent of approximately 160 C-17 loads of material out of Afghanistan and has turned over more than 10,000 pieces of equipment to the Defense Logistics Agency for disposition.

Supreme State Council Will Only Focus on Peace, Mohib Says
","
The Supreme State Council,  on which the government is working for the last four weeks, would focus on peace affairs as its main task, the National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib said Saturday, responding to recent concerns by politicians on the authorities and responsibilities of the council.
He reiterated that the council will not be involved in any other issue and that government leaders will handle governance affairs.
“Peace is the main topic. The issue of governance remains in its place because the Constitution is there when it comes to governance,” Mohib said.
The idea to form the council has been met with reactions from political leaders and analysts who oppose its formation and say that the High Council for National Reconciliation is already there to deal with peace affairs.
Echoing such remarks, a senior aide to Abdullah Abdullah said the Supreme State Council should be involved in all issues of national importance while the reconciliation should lead the peace efforts.
“If the idea is that the supreme state council will focus only on the peace process, it will not be like that, because there is the High Council for National Reconciliation that conducts peace affairs,” said Assadullah Saadati, the deputy head of the High Council for National Reconciliation.
“When you establish an entity as the Supreme State Council, it means that it will deal with a set of major national issues in the political, security, and economic arenas,” Saadati said.
The council is also faced with criticism about the number of its members. The government has said that the council will have at least 21 members, including four women. However, the Hizb-e-Islami party led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar has suggested a smaller number for members of the council.
Saadati said that the government should address concerns raised by politicians on the council to establish it through a major national consensus.
The efforts to form the council come as violence remains high in the country and the peace negotiations in Doha have been paused over since April.

NDS Chief Says Taliban Under Pressure on Battlefields
","
Taliban has been under increasing pressure by government forces on multiple fronts and has suffered a major setback in different regions over the last few weeks as they have mounted their attacks on Afghanistan's defense and security forces, the Afghan intelligence chief Ahmad Zia Saraj said. 
Saraj said that 1,500 Taliban militants were killed in just one week. The Defense Ministry said Saturday that 210 Taliban fighters were killed in counterattacks by Afghan forces in 18 provinces in the last 24 hours.  
Saraj said that the pressure by Afghan forces on the Taliban has created cracks among their ranks, mounting pressure on their designated military chief Mullah Yaqub. 
“Casualties have also created major problems among their leadership. Pressure has increased on Mullah Yaqub because he has failed to use these people in their desired directions; therefore, they have started recruiting children,” Saraj said. 
Taliban has rejected the figures on their casualties. 
Saraj said that Afghan forces have managed to repel a series of Taliban’s massive offensives on a few strategic locations across the country.

Hekmatyar Says Agreements Made with Ghani Not Implemented

Eighteen days after his meeting with President Ashraf Ghani and former president Hamid Karzai, Hizb-e-Islami leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar said that eight issues over which he reached an agreement with Ghani have not been implemented, saying the Afghan president could not gather his (Ghani's) team's support on the agreed points.
Ghani, Karzai and Hekmatyar discussed the following issues last week: The participation at the Istanbul conference with a unified plan, the establishment of a short-term transitional government, holding elections, the establishment of a decision-making council, the release of Taliban and Hizb-e-Islami prisoners, permanent ceasefire and convening the constitutional Loya Jirga (a grand council) to amend the Constitution.
The meeting happened earlier this month and was facilitated by former president Karzai.
“Regretfully, the president was faced with problems within his government team and could not get everyone’s agreement--neither on the peace plan nor on the Supreme Council and its formation and powers,” Hekmatyar said. 
Hekmatyar said that the president had vowed to share the agreed points with his colleagues and would implement them within eight days after the meeting, but Hekmatyar said this has not happened. 
Hekmatyar said that an inclusive plan for peace will be formed if the agreements are implemented. He suggested that this plan should be shared with the Taliban leaders through Afghan politicians in a secret meeting.
“We leave the selection of the three options to the government. Accept the agreements of the trilateral meeting--select one of the two new options--otherwise, we will have no choice but to make our independent decision on peace and on the overarching situation,” Hekmatyar said.
He said the government is losing its ground and warned that if his agreements are not implemented by the administration, he would make decisions unilaterally.
Some politicians, however, said that the persistence of such differences and the formation of councils that are parallel to already existing entities in the government will not be in Afghanistan’s favor.
“Let’s not spend the budget, not waste the time and not connect with another invalid period,” the deputy speaker of the Senate, Mohammad Alam Ezedyar, said.

Translators, Local Staff for Foreigners Fear Troop Pullout
","
As US and NATO troops continue withdrawing from Afghanistan, dozens of Afghan workers who have partnered with foreigners over the past 20 years are concerned about the situation and are seeking protection.     
Translators and other local employees of the French military forces in Afghanistan at a gathering in Kabul said they are faced with increasing threats from various groups, and they ask the French government to grant them asylum in France immediately.     
Concerned about the approach of September 11 - the deadline for all foreign troops to leave Afghanistan – these translators and employees said their lives would face serious threats after all foreign troops including France leave the country.     
“I have worked with the French military in Afghanistan for more than ten years, but unfortunately, the French government does not pay any attention to us and we are at risk,” said Ahmad Siyar, a former employee of French forces in Afghanistan. ""Granting us an immigration visa to France before the September 11 deadline is what we are demanding,"" he said.
 
Ahmad Yama Heidari, another former employee of French forces in Afghanistan, said: “If they leave us behind, we will all be beheaded like those who faced such an act before.”     
The workers say that staying in Afghanistan is like a nightmare for them because they receive constant threats because they worked with coalition forces.  
“Most countries have withdrawn their personnel (local staff) from Afghanistan, but France has not yet taken action. We are protesting here because we want to legally migrate to France,” said Maiwand Hotak, a former employee of French forces in Afghanistan.     
“I have worked with France’s PCL company for seven years. I came here to ask the government and the Ministry of Defense of France to grant me an immigration visa to France,” said Zubair, a former French forces employee in Afghanistan.     
Meanwhile, another group of Afghans who have worked with Canadian forces in Afghanistan gathered in front of the Canadian embassy in Kabul and called on the Canadian government and the United Nations to help them find asylum in Western countries as foreign troops, including Canadians, are leaving the country by September 11.  
The translators and employees, who were employed by the Canada forces in Afghanistan, said they have been repeatedly threatened with death and will not be able to live in Afghanistan after the complete withdrawal of foreign troops.     
“I worked at Camp Julien in Dar-Ul-Aman from  2003 to  2005 and where we were working was such an exposed place that everyone could easily identify us, most people knew where we were working. I have been threatened many times with people saying that 'if the time comes, we will hold you accountable for what you did in the past,'” said Noor, a former translator with Canadian Forces in Afghanistan.     
“In the last 15 years, I did not apply for a visa because the country was partly secure and the situation was not as bad as it is today. Now the threats have increased, our children cannot go to school and we cannot walk around and travel safely,"" said Shafiullah, a former translator with Canadian forces in Afghanistan.”     
Ehsanullah, another former translator of the Canadian Forces in Afghanistan, said: “We are about 40 to 50 people in total, we were working at Camp Julien in Kabul. Now that the Canadian and foreign troops are leaving Afghanistan, we want to be moved to Canada.” He said: “Our lives and our families' lives are in jeopardy.”     
Thousands of Afghans have worked with foreign forces in Afghanistan as translators and workers since the coalition forces came to Afghanistan in  2001. The exact number of these locally-employed staff is not available.     
Afghan translators and other employees who have worked with foreign forces in Afghanistan have been threatened by various groups for cooperating with these forces. Dozens have lost their lives while hundreds have been wounded.
A number of foreign countries who were operating in Afghanistan for the past 20 years under NATO have provided immigration visas to many of their Afghan local workers to protect them from threats.      
Recently, the United States government announced that it would provide special immigrant visas to 18,000 Afghan translators and their families who backed US missions during the past 20 years.

It also follows two meetings of Republic negotiators with the Taliban delegation in Doha, including one meeting with their deputy leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, who for the first time met with negotiators on May 13, the first day of Eid.
The Taliban has recently signaled a willingness to resume the stalled talks with Republic negotiators.
“Some of us will leave (for Doha) on Monday or Tuesday and then all the delegation will be there,” Republic negotiator Nader Nadery said. “Ensuring peace, making an effort to end the war and to establish a common future within the bounds of the Afghan achievements of the last years is a priority for the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and for its people and government.”
The Republic team believes that the Taliban will not be ready for meaningful participation in the upcoming Turkey conference and therefore the talks in Doha might take more time than expected.
“It would be too soon to expect a result in one month, two months, six months, or a year--same as other peace processes,” Nadery said.
The remarks on the Doha talks come a day after National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib said that according to intelligence information, Taliban leader Mullah Hibatullah has been “missing” for the last 12 months. The Taliban has denied this statement, calling it baseless and saying the group is ready for the continuation of talks in Doha.
“There has been no news about Hibatullah for the last 12 months. The Taliban themselves have not heard anything from him for the last 12 months,” Mohib said.
“We hope that the Taliban agrees on peace. There is no more excuse for war. Foreign forces are leaving,” said Zabihullah Mujaddedi, the leader of Jabha-e-Nejat-e-Milli (Afghan National Liberation Front).
The negotiations in Doha faced continued delays after the announcement of US President Joe Biden to withdraw all his troops from the country by Sept. 11, extending the May 1 deadline that was agreed upon in the US-Taliban agreement. But the two meetings of the negotiators this month created hope on the Republic side for a renewed peace process.

State Council to Begin Functioning This Week: Official
","
The Supreme State Council, which the government and political leaders have been working to finalize over the last few weeks, will begin functioning by the end of this week, said Enayatullah Babur Farahmand, an aide to Abdullah Abdullah. He said the council will deal with Afghanistan's foreign policies among other national issues. This contradicts earlier remarks by President Ashraf Ghani's national security adviser who said the council will focus only on peace.
The mandate of the council, the number of its members, and whether it will focus exclusively on peace or other national issues have been the main issues debated by politicians who would be members of the council. Ghani’s aides have said the council will have at least 21 members, including four women, while some politicians, including Hekmatyar, have pushed for a smaller number.
“Remarks by some officials indicate a lack of information--the Supreme State Council, which is comprised of influential political Afghan leaders, will have all national issues--including peace, war, the appointment of high-ranking officials and other national issues--as its mandate,” said Enayatullah Babur Farahmand, the deputy head of the High Council for National Reconciliation.
President Ghani’s adviser Akram Khpulwak said the council will have decision-making authority on national issues. He said President Ghani will decide on the date for the first meeting of the council by the end of this week.
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of Hizb-e-Islami, was expected to be a member of the council but said on Sunday that he has decided not to be part of it as he faced opposition to his recommendation for an eight-member formation and the limits of the council's powers.
“So far, they have not succeeded in solving their internal problem. So far, they do not have a unified and clear plan. So far, they have not been able to form a reliable decision-making capability,” said Hekmatyar.
Habiba Sarabi, a Republic negotiator who is slated to be member of the council, said the presence of women in the state council would be key to progress in its activities.
“I hope that some politicians who are not so much in agreement on the presence of women consider that women make up half of society and are a complement to it. Human society is incomplete without women. They should remember this and they should not insist on a lesser presence for women in the council,” Sarabi said.
The efforts for the formation of the council have been expedited as peace talks in Doha have stalled and violence has remained high in various parts of the country. The Defense Ministry has been reporting clashes in at least 18 provinces on a daily basis over the last two weeks.

20 Afghan Civilians Killed, 30 Wounded in Latest Violence
","
A new wave of violence in five provinces over the last 24 hours killed at least 20 civilians and wounded 34 others.
One of the incidents was a magnetic IED blast that targeted a bus carrying lecturers and employees of Alberoni University in Parwan province on Saturday evening. Maiwand Frooq Nijrabi, a medicine faculty lecturer at the university, was among those killed in the incident along with three of his colleagues. He was laid to rest in Kabul on Monday. 17 more people were reportedly wounded in the incident.
“The daily violence takes our youth, religious scholars and soldiers. If this continues, we will witness a dangerous crisis,” said Moeen Mirzada, a relative of Maiwand Farooq Nijrabi.
“The enemy is not committed to any Islamic or human law,” said Fayiq Azimi, a relative of Nijrabi.
Two civilians were killed and one more was wounded in an explosion in Shirzad district in Nangarhar on Sunday evening.
Meanwhile, in Tagab district in Kapisa province, at least 10 civilians were killed when a mortar landed on a home where a wedding ceremony was underway. Sources said 15 more people were wounded in the incident.
The village where the incident happened was near a frontline battle where government forces and Taliban were exchanging fire. Kapisa police confirmed the incident and said six people were killed and that the mortar “was fired by the Taliban.” The Taliban has rejected this claim.
“The increase in violence will challenge our approach to peace and will complicate the way to peace,” said Mir Haidar Afzali, an MP from Kapisa.
“The Taliban is responsible for civilian casualties and the attacks they conduct are crimes under international law,” said Tariq Arian, spokesman for the Ministry of Interior Affairs.
Parts of the country witnessed security incidents in the last 24 hours. On Sunday morning a university lecturer was killed in Farah, and in Kabul, a government employee and his driver were killed.
Reports by officials and other sources indicate that 12 security force members were killed and six more were wounded in clashes in Helmand, Herat, Badghis and Paktia provinces.
“Both sides are making efforts to suppress each other and highlight their military power so that they can gain a greater advantage in the upcoming peace summits,” said Zahir Masroor, an MP from Balkh.
Figures by the Ministry of Interior Affairs show that 248 civilians were killed and 527 more were wounded “in Taliban attacks” in the last month. The Taliban has rejected these numbers.

Hundreds More Afghan Local Staff to be Allowed to Settle in UK
","
Hundreds of Afghans who have worked as interpreters or in other roles as local staff for the UK government or British military will be allowed to relocate, the UK government announced.
In a statement, the government said: ""Following the decision to begin the withdrawal of military forces from Afghanistan, the prime minister has agreed with the Ministry of Defence, Home Office and Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government to rapidly accelerate applications through the policy.""
The exact number of Afghans allowed to be relocated to the UK in this latest plan is unclear, but the government says it is expecting more than 3,000 to be resettled. This number includes both eligible local staff and their families.
Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said those that might otherwise ""be at risk of reprisals"" from the Taliban were being considered.
""With Western powers leaving Afghanistan, the threat is increasing and has increased, including targeted attacks by the Taliban,” Wallace said.
""This is allowing people a route to the United Kingdom for safety, the people who supported the British armed forces and the British government over many, many years in Afghanistan who feel they are in danger and it's absolutely right that we stand by those people,” he said.
Wallace told the BBC that ""with Western powers leaving, the threat is increasing, including targeted attacks by the Taliban"".
Most of those affected worked as interpreters for British troops and the acceleration of plans allowing them to settle in the UK comes amid fears for these workers' safety with the ongoing pullout of foreign troops, which is scheduled to end on September 11, 2021.
The report said that hundreds of interpreters have already settled in the UK in an earlier version of the plan.

700 Attacks Launched on Lashkargah in 3 Weeks: ANA Commander
","
The Taliban has conducted roughly 700 attacks on the city of Lashkargah in the southern province of Helmand over the last three weeks, an army commander said, adding that the group was “helped by al-Qaeda fighters” in their attacks on the southern city. 
The 215 Maiwand Corps Commander, Gen. Sami Sadat, said that nearly '30 al-Qaeda fighters' were killed in Afghan force operations that were conducted in response to the Taliban attacks and that the military has gathered evidence of their identities along with other documents.
The attacks were mostly focused on Lashkargah City’s District 10 and District 3 – on the outskirts of the city – and parts of these two areas temporarily fell to the Taliban.
“Al-Qaeda fighters have fought against our troops on the frontlines. At least 30 of them have been killed in the clashes in the last three weeks,” Gen. Sadat said.
Helmand officials said that at least 4,500 families were displaced during the clashes and sought shelter in other parts of Lashkargah.
“We have pushed the enemies back from the city and we are pursuing them to take more (territory) back,” said Hedayat Rasuli, a battalion commander for the border forces.
“The enemy is beyond those walls. They are seen there sometimes,” said Ebadullah, a police soldier.
Ahmad, a teenager who is a resident of Lashkargah, stayed at his home--letting his family leave--despite ongoing clashes in the area.
“The problems cannot be solved this way. We pray to God to bring peace,” said Ahmad.
Some families were displaced three weeks back and shifted from the Bolan area to the central parts of Lashkargah. 
“We left only with our clothes… We don’t have even have food,” said Ko Jana, a displaced person. 
Taliban attacks on Lashkargah intensified following the announcement of the withdrawal of foreign forces from the country. 
Security forces pledged that they will ensure that the province remains safe from Taliban threats.

Karzai Seeks Peace Talks Among Afghans Within Afghanistan
","
Former president Hamid Karzai on Monday called on the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban to organize peace meetings within the country, reiterating that peace should be changed into a national process in order for results to be achieved.
Addressing an event on peace, Karzai said the US’s efforts for peace in Afghanistan have had no results; therefore, he said, violence continues to take a toll on the people.
“And here, both sides ... who have been placed against each other--the Taliban’s Islamic movement, and the Republic--they have a national duty to own the process through our initiative and to see our success within a month,” Karzai said.
He said that the Islamic republic and the Taliban should turn the peace process into an Afghan-led process by holding sessions within the country.
“Let’s make it on our soil. We have a place. I hope that the Islamic movement of the Taliban and our own government come and say 'let’s go to Bamiyan where we have beautiful places as well as beautiful weather, where we don’t need an air conditioner,'” he said.
Politicians who attended the event said that the Taliban’s quest for war and the lack of political consensus, the monopolization of power at the Presidential Palace, and “wrong” policies by the government are the main reasons behind the event stalemate in the peace process.
“Is (the system) worth defending? Gradually our police, too, will ask these questions. The reality is that our security forces did not fight in Laghman. It should be asked: Why didn’t they fight?” said Mohammad Omar Zakhilwal, head of Harakat-e-Nejat-e-Afghanistan, a political movement.
“The biggest hurdle to peace are those forces that fuel war and kill our civilians and our forces,” former national security adviser Rangin Dadfar Spanta said.
“We hope to have a peace forum among Afghans and between Afghans,” said Jafar Mahdawi, head of the Millat-e-Afghanistan Party.
The participants said that the government's breaking of its commitments to the people has affected the people’s trust in the administration.
“Show me one place where this government would have followed its commitment to anyone. When we have a government that breaks its commitment and lacks trust, then who will talk with who?” asked Abdul Salam Abid, a religious scholar.
“A responsible withdrawal means that the 20 years of war in Afghanistan either results in peace or at least provides a clear reason for a continued war in Afghanistan,” said Shahgul Rezaee, an MP from Ghazni.
Karzai's remarks come a day after the Republic negotiators said that they will travel to Doha on Tuesday. But it is not known so far that when they will resume their negotiations with the Taliban.

Anti-Corruption Commission Demands Details of Customs Allegations
","
Eleven days after remarks by the acting finance minister on the embezzlement of at least $8 million a day in the country’s customs, the Independent Anti-Corruption Commission on Monday said it needs details on the claims to complete its investigation. 
Talking to lawmakers at a plenary session this month, acting Finance Minister Khalid Payenda vowed to disclose the names of those who are involved in the embezzlement of money from customs on a daily basis, but the details have not been made public so far.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Commission, which was formed last November, has assessed 19 cases of corruption, according to its director, Abdul Qayum Nizami.
“It is the legal responsibility of the acting finance minister when he raises such an issue to have documents and information, and to share this information at the earliest opportunity,” Nizami said.
The Ministry of Finance said that investigations into this case are underway. 
“We have started our assessment of this. We will share our findings with MPs once the assessment is done,” said Rafi Tabe, spokesman for the Ministry of Finance.
Some MPs said that keeping information secret about the customs corruption case is a kind of treason.
“Most of the institutions that have been established to fight corruption have had a political nature,” said Abdul Rauf Inami, a member of Parliament's finance and budget committee.

Khalid Says Intl Forces May Continue Air Support After Pullout
","
Defense Minister Asadullah Khalid on Tuesday said air support by international troops aiding Afghan forces might continue even after the end of the foreign military presence in Afghanistan if necessary. 
“The world has a commitment and agreement with us. When needed--if we want and need it--their air force will help us in areas where we need it,” Khalid said. 
Khalid, in his first official appearance after several months away, in an address to a graduation ceremony of army special forces assured the Afghan forces that the country will not fall to militants. 
“This homeland will not fall to the enemy. We have good experience. We will not allow anyone to cause the fall of the army. We--and you--are the protectors of peace,” Khalid said.
He said that Afghan forces have proved they are capable of defending each and every corner of the country. He says Afghan forces are conducting operations independently.
Khalid added that the Afghan government has made the utmost effort for peace, but the Taliban has continuously insisted on violence. He says the Taliban has no legitimate reason to continue the violence in the country.
Khalid said he hopes that the Taliban stops the violence and moves toward the peace process.
“They should remember Arghandab, Qara Bagh, Laghman, Baghlan, Helmand and other places. They have suffered heavy losses and have been heavily suppressed whenever they have faced commando forces,” said Gen. Haibatullah Alizai, the commander of the special operations corps.
His remarks come as violence has remained high in the country in the last few weeks. Parwan, in the center of Afghanistan, has witnessed four security incidents in the last week.
Two security force members have been killed in attacks by unknown armed men in the province and the Taliban set fire to a security outpost in Koh-e-Safi district. Four security force members were killed and wounded in a Taliban attack on an outpost in the Shinwari district.
“Two police vehicles were targeted in the Ghorband Ha district. Also, targeted attacks have occurred in the center of Parwan and its outskirts,” said Aminullah Shakoori, head of the Parwan provincial council.
Meanwhile, the Taliban launched attacks in Kunduz, Baghlan, Badakhshan, Helmand, Zabul, Faryab and Helmand provinces last night. However, security agencies said the attacks resulted in no casualties to Afghan forces.
“Pressure is brought on one province. The forces focus on that. Then pressure is mounted on another province and the forces focus there. Ultimately, this makes the forces tired,” said Mahdi Rasikh, an MP.

Security Situation in Afghanistan Remains Challenging: NATO Chief
","
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Monday said that the security situation in Afghanistan remains “very difficult and challenging,” reiterating that as the US and coalition forces are leaving, at some stage, Afghans should take full responsibility for their own future. 
Pentagon officials have said that the withdrawal up to 25% complete. US President Joe Biden announced in April that he will withdraw all American troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, but officials in Washington have said that the pullout might be completed earlier than the given deadline.  
Back in Kabul, efforts are underway to resume the stalled peace talks in Doha and form a Supreme State Council to lead the peace process and make decisions on it. However, violence remains high as Taliban conduct attacks in at least 18 provinces every day, based on data provided by the Ministry of Defense.  
Addressing a press conference in Brussels, Stoltenberg said that the decision to withdraw NATO troops entails risks, but also to stay, “we’d have implemented risks for our Alliance with more fighting, potentially more fighting, more and more casualties, and even the need to maybe increase the number of troops.”  
He added, “So therefore, we made the decision to end our mission within weeks. I think we have to understand that the intention was never to stay in Afghanistan forever.”
He said that over the last years, NATO has gradually reduced its presence in Afghanistan from more than 100,000 troops to around 10,000 troops at the beginning of this year and that now it will go down to zero in the military mission.  
“But as we end our military mission, we are stepping up our support to Afghanistan in other ways. First of all, we will maintain our civilian presence in Afghanistan to provide advice and capacity building to the Afghan security institutions,” he said.  
He reiterated that NATO would fund the Afghan forces and will “make sure that we are allocating significant amounts of money to the Afghan security forces.”  
“We will also provide, we are planning to provide out-of-country training for the Afghan security forces and we are also now working on how we can sustain critical infrastructure,” he added. 
This comes as Afghan Defense Minister Asadullah Khalid on Tuesday said air support by international troops aiding Afghan forces might continue even after the end of the foreign military presence in Afghanistan if necessary.  
“The world has a commitment and agreement with us. When needed--if we want and need it--their air force will help us in areas where we need it,” Khalid said.   
Moreover, Stoltenberg said that Afghan forces are now responsible for the security in their own country.  
“At some stage the Afghans have to take full responsibility, responsibility for their own future,” he said. “And I’m impressed by the strength and the courage of the Afghan security forces and knowing that there are risks, challenges, but also that's exactly why we will continue to provide support to them.”

Fawzia Koofi, a peace negotiator, human rights activist and former legislator, was recognized as one of the ""World’s 50 Greatest Leaders"" by Fortune Magazine. 
Koofi said that she will see herself as a leader whenever Afghanistan and its people live in peace. 
“If the situation is in a way that we end killing and violence through negotiations, I think in that case, despite all the hardships the process faces, we can be hopeful for peace, and yes, we might be able to address all the demands of Afghans. But the basic rights and human rights that we deserve--and that Afghan women deserve--should be ensured in the peace process,” Koofi said. 
Koofi was the first woman in Afghanistan’s history to serve as deputy speaker of the Wolesi Jirga, the lower house of the Parliament. 
She is head of the Mawj-e-Tahawul-e-Afghanistan party and is the first Afghan woman to lead a political party.

Ghulam Farooq Nejrabi, a former presidential candidate, is one of the civilians whose life was devastated after a mine blast on Saturday killed his son, who was a university lecturer in Parwan province.
Since Saturday, Nejrabi has been sleeping next to the grave of his son.
“I come every night and sleep beside him because I can't be separated from him,” said Nejrabi.
“They (attackers) ask themselves, who could serve the country, my son or yours? Unfortunately, they did not allow him to serve,” said Nejrabi.
In the last hours of May, four security force members were killed in a car bomb attack by the Taliban on the police headquarters in Baghlan-e-Markazi district in the northern province of Baghlan on Monday evening.
“The explosion was very powerful, people were hurt even 500 meters away from the explosion, the majority of the victims are our civilians,” said Fahim Khan Saeedkheli, the commander of the ANA's 3rd Division, in Baghlan.
“The Afghan people are being killed and wounded on a daily basis,” said MP Sadiq Qaderi.
Casualties sometimes reach 100 per day, according to some unofficial estimates. 
The Taliban claim that their casualties are less than the casualties among Afghan security forces.
Meanwhile, Afghan security officials in southern Afghanistan said that the Taliban has conducted roughly 700 attacks on the city of Lashkargah in the southern province of Helmand over the last three weeks.
The 215 Maiwand Corps Commander, Gen. Sami Sadat, said that nearly '30 al-Qaeda fighters' were killed in Afghan security operations that were conducted in response to the Taliban attacks and that the military has gathered evidence of their identities.
The attacks were mostly focused on Lashkargah City’s District 10 and District 3 – on the outskirts of the city – and parts of these two areas temporarily fell to the Taliban.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Monday said that the security situation in Afghanistan remains “very difficult and challenging,” and reiterated that as the US and coalition forces leave, ""at some stage, Afghans should take full responsibility for their own future.""
Pentagon officials have said that the withdrawal from Afghanistan is ""up to 25% complete."" US President Joe Biden announced in April that he will withdraw all American troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, but officials in Washington have said that the pullout might be completed earlier than the given deadline. 
In Kabul, efforts are underway to resume the stalled peace talks in Doha and to form a Supreme State Council to lead the peace process. However, violence remains high as the Taliban launches attacks in at least 18 provinces every day, based on data provided by the Ministry of Defense.

Afghan Student Wins Science Olympiad Competition in Iran
","
Mohammad Masih Hamidi, an Afghan student, won the first-position title in an Olympiad event that ended on Saturday in Iran.  
This is the first time since the establishment of the Science Olympiad program that an Afghan student wins first place in a scientific competition in Iran.  
The Olympiad scientific competition included 1,680 students, mostly Iranians, who were in the final semester of their bachelor’s degree during the solar year 1399 (2020).
“Recently, I learned that I had won the first position title in students’ Mathematical Olympiad. I am happy and proud of it not only for seeing the result of my efforts, but I could make my beloved people happy, which is a big pride for me,” said Mohammad Masih Hamidi, first position owner of Iran’s Olympiad scientific competition.  
Hamidi was born in Iran’s Mashhad city and is currently pursuing his master’s degree.  
Hamidi went to school in Mashhad when only a limited number of Afghan migrants were allowed to study at school and university in Iran.  
When Hamidi was a child he could not join a school that was near to his house because Afghans were not allowed to join Iranian schools and could only join those rare schools set apart for Afghans.  
After failing to get permission from the nearest school, he joined an Afghan school that was in a remote area that required expensive daily travel by car. 
 “I was interested in mathematics from the time I began school. I participated in the Kankor in 1395 and achieved 811th position among 150,000 participants, mostly Iranians, and so I could continue studying in my favorite field, which was mathematics.” Hamidi said.  
Afghans who live and study in Iran said the country still applies restrictions on Afghan migrants who are willing to pursue studies or want to go to school and university.  
Even those Afghans who earn high scores in the Kankor exam (university entry test) in Iran are allowed to select only limited subjects at certain universities and are obliged to pay money to continue their studies, while Iranians study free of costs.
Zohra Tajik, who has a master’s degree in mechanical engineering from Iran and is currently a lecturer in Afghanistan, says that there are many overwhelming challenges in the way of Afghans trying to obtain higher education in Iran.  
Tajik says that even though her mother is Iranian, she needed to pay to continue her education in Iran, and she could not choose the university where she wanted to study.  
“With the support of my father, I could pursue my master’s degree in Iran. Though I participated in both master’s and bachelor’s degrees through the Kankor exam, I had to pay the study cost that was assigned by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Government of Iran, my father used to pay those costs. Most of my friends could not afford it and they left their remaining studies.”  
According to information provided by the Afghan Ministry of Higher Education, about one thousand Afghan students are studying in Iran under government scholarships.

'NATO Will Continue Civilian Diplomatic Presence in Kabul'
","
As US and coalition forces have started troops withdrawal from Afghanistan, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance will continue its civilian diplomatic presence in Kabul to provide advice and capacity-building support to Afghan security institutions. 
He made the remarks following the meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Defense Ministers’ session on Tuesday. 
Stoltenberg said NATO will continue to provide funding to the Afghan security forces. 
“We are also looking at how we can provide military education and training outside Afghanistan, focused on Special Operations Forces,” he said. “And we are working on how to fund the provision of services enabling Allies and the international community to stay in Kabul, including support for the airport.” 
Stoltenberg said that NATO defense ministers agreed that this continued support is the best way “in which we can all contribute to peace efforts in Afghanistan.” 
In response to a question on Australia’s announcement of the closure of its embassy in Kabul, he said, “NATO is ending its military mission, the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, but we will continue to provide support and we will do that in different ways.” 
“NATO Allies are working together to make sure that we can provide support to important infrastructure, to support the international community at large,” he mentioned. 
Stoltenberg said that they are aware that “the situation in Afghanistan is challenging, fragile and difficult, but added that “the way forward in Afghanistan is easy, and there are serious risks.” 
He reiterated that NATO allies during their two decades of presence in Afghanistan have  
helped “to build a professional, strong Afghan army and security force, which has proven very capable.” 
Stoltenberg reiterated that “the only way to have a lasting, peaceful solution in Afghanistan is to have an Afghan-owned an Afghan-led peace process, and that the Afghans are in full charge of their own future.” 
Meanwhile, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that in addressing Afghanistan and Iraq, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin discussed the retrograde in Afghanistan, pledging to support Afghanistan and work hand in hand with NATO as the Resolute Support Mission transitions to a civilian-led engagement.  
He also affirmed that the United States remains firmly committed to defeating Daesh and supporting the Government of Iraq.

Fire On Iran Navy Ship At Mouth Of Gulf, Crew Evacuated: Report
","
A fire broke out in an Iranian navy vessel near the mouth of the Gulf, but the entire crew was able to safely disembark, the semi-official news agency Fars quoted a navy statement as saying on Wednesday. 
Firefighting operations continued on board the ship which was near the Iranian port of Jask situated on the Gulf of Oman, the statement said, adding that the vessel was on a training mission. 
The statement did not give the cause of the fire. 
In April, Iran said one of its vessels, the Saviz, had been targeted in the Red Sea, after media reports the ship had been attacked with limpet mines. 
It was the latest in a reported series of attacks on Israeli- and Iranian-owned cargo ships since late February in 
which the two arch-enemies accused each other of responsibility. 
Last year, an Iranian warship accidentally struck another with a missile during an exercise, killing 19 sailors and wounding 15 others. 
The incident took place during training in the Gulf of Oman, a sensitive waterway that connects to the Strait of Hormuz through which about a fifth of the world's oil passes. Iran regularly conducts exercises in the area.

MPs Accuse President Ghani of Violating Constitution
","
Lawmakers in Afghanistan’s Wolesi Jirga—the lower house of Parliament--on Wednesday accused President Ashraf Ghani of violating the country’s Constitution, stating that some of the calamities that the nation faces today are rooted in the violation of Afghanistan’s Constitution by the president and other high-level government officials.
Citing acting ministers, the lawmakers said that the government’s failure to address the problems caused by an incomplete cabinet raises serious questions about the credibility of the government.
Currently, at least 10 ministries are being run by caretakers--acting ministers. The government has also failed to appoint several members of the Supreme Court, the governor of the Central Bank of Afghanistan, and a member of the Constitution oversight commission.
“We want the culture of caretakers to end in the ministries,” said MP Najibullah Naser.
“The law states that the caretakers do not have any legal status, but today these caretakers act beyond the authority of the cabinet ministers,” said MP Zakira Sangeen.
Lawmakers said that the government is practicing nepotism in the appointment of government officials instead of taking advantage of the academic cadres in the country.
“I think we don’t have any other option except to close down the national assembly because of the govt’s reluctance to appoint the ministers,” said MP Ibdalullah Mohammadi.
“Unfortunately, today the security sector has lost its national status and it is now ethnic-oriented, this is an act of oppression against the soldiers and the Afghan people,” said MP Gul Ahmad Noorzad.
The lawmakers also criticized the government institutions of corruption.

The majority of the victims of the two explosions that targeted city buses in Kabul on Tuesday night were members of poor families.
Qurban Ali, 70, was a vendor in Kabul who was in one of the buses and was on his way home after a long day to win bread for his family.
“He was coming home at 6:00 or 7:00 pm daily, we waited for him last night and finally we received a phone call from the hospital that he had been wounded. We rushed to the hospital and saw that he had no hand and his leg was also damaged,” said Mohammad Ibrahim, the son of Qurban Ali.
“My husband was going to work like a brave man, but they sent his dead body ... people in the bus were killed,” said Nafas Gul, the wife of Qurban Ali.
Victims’ families have said that they do not think the government will hear their voice and arrest the perpetrators who planned the attacks on the civilians.
Muslim, 21, was wounded in the second blast. He says that the attack was very powerful and he was the only survivor from the packed bus.
“We were around ten people in the bus, I saw only cut-off legs and hands and the bus had caught fire,” said Muslim.

Taliban Control Key Dam in Kandahar, Farmers Plead for Water
","
Dahla Dam, a main irrigation source for surrounding areas in Kandahar, continues to remain under Taliban control for the past month.
The Dahla Dam is one of the main water sources providing water to agricultural land in seven districts in the province. But the Taliban's control of the dam has deprived farmers of irrigation water.
Farmers in Kandahar said their gardens and agricultural lands will be devastated if swift action is not taken to continue the flow of water.
The Taliban said that irrigation experts are allowed to come and regulate the water distribution from the dam to the farmers' fields. But the Afghan government has said that it plans to launch an operation to clear the area from Taliban control.
Lands in Arghandab, Shah Wali Kot, Zhari, Maiwand, Panjwayi, Daman and Dand districts are dependent on the water that flows from the Dahla Dam. 
“Water is the blessing of God and we are Muslims, why is the government closing the dam, why are they destroying the country?"" asked Hairan, a farmer in Kandahar.
“It is now the season of growth of pomegranates, if water does not come, they will be affected,” said Kandahar farmer Abdul Raziq.
“The operation moves forward in a good way, our forces will soon get their objectives,” said Ghorzang Afridi, the head of the security department at Kandahar police headquarters.

Deputy Speaker of Afghan Senate Demands Justice for Death of Son
","
Family members of protestors who were killed by police gunfire in Kabul in 2017, and those who lost their loved ones in a truck bombing in Zanbaq square in the same year, on Wednesday accused the Afghan government--particularly the Afghan legal and judicial institutions--of failing to prosecute those responsible for the attack.
The victims' families said that the government is deliberately choosing not to bring the criminals to justice.
Speaking on the 4th anniversary of the 2017 attack, Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the High Council of National Reconciliation, and Mohammad Mohaqiq, the leader of Hizb-e-Wahdat-e-Islami, also criticized the Afghan legal and judicial institutions for failing to address the demands of the victims for justice. The two leaders said that inaction by these entities creates gaps between the government and the people and the entire legal system.
“There is a decision to raise the case in the Hague court,” said Kalikmullah Hamsukhan, a member of the Rastakhiz-e-Tagheer Movement.
“The head of the government to low-level officials, and those who have a role in the decision-making and those who were in the ranks of the leadership of the National Unity Government--are involved in the murder,” said Mohammad Alam Ezedyar, the deputy of the Meshrano Jirga, the Afghan Senate.
“When someone serves in the post of deputy speaker of the Senate, and his son has been sacrificed, and the case is on its fourth year, then what will the poor people do?” said Fazel Hadi Muslimyar, the head of the Senate.
“If we are not able to provide an answer to this basic question asked by the people, of course, the situation will be as it is today,” said Abdullah.

The protests turned violent and police opened fire, killing 12 protestors including Salim Ezedyar, the son of Mohammad Alam Ezedyar, the deputy speaker of Afghanistan’s Meshrano Jirga.

Taliban Still Closely Tied to Al Qaeda: UN Report
","
A report by the UN Monitoring Team released on Wednesday said that “the Taliban and Al-Qaeda remain closely aligned and show no indication of breaking ties.”
18 Member States report “no material changes to this relationship, which has grown deeper as a consequence of personal bonds of marriage and shared partnership in struggle, now cemented through second generational ties.”
This comes as foreign troops withdraw from Afghanistan and plan to leave completely by September 11.
As part of last year's agreement between the preceding Trump administration and the Taliban, the group promised to instruct its members ""not to cooperate with groups or individuals.”
“While the Doha agreement has set some expectations for a break in the longstanding relationship between the Taliban and Al Qaeda, the publicly available text of the agreement does not define expectations, and its annexes remain secret,” the report said.
According to UN member state information, “Al Qaeda is resident in at least 15 Afghan provinces, primarily in the east, southern and south-eastern regions, and are led by Al-Qaeda’s Jabhat-al-Nasr wing under the direction of Sheikh Mahmood.”
“19 Members of the group have been relocated to more remote areas by the Taliban to avoid potential exposure and targeting,” it said.
According to UN member states, “Al-Qaeda maintains contact with the Taliban but has minimized overt communications with Taliban leadership in an effort to 'lay low' and not jeopardize the Taliban’s diplomatic position vis-à-vis the Doha agreement.""
The report said that ""Member States reported that a significant part of Al Qaeda leadership remains based in the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan, where the core is joined by and works closely with Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent.""
The report stated:
“Al Qaeda’s own strategy in the near term is assessed as maintaining its traditional safe haven in Afghanistan for the Al Qaeda core leadership, the Monitoring Team takes note of assessments that have suggested a longer-term Al Qaida core strategy of strategic patience for a period of time before it would seek to plan attacks against international targets again. This scenario is untested against stated Taliban commitments to prohibit such activities.”
""Although ... Member States assess that formal communication between senior Al Qaida and Taliban officials is currently infrequent, one Member State reported that there is regular communication between the Taliban and Al-Qaeda on issues related to the peace process,” the report said.
Amid foreign troop withdrawal, the violence in Afghanistan is at its highest level in two decades.
According to the UN report, 2020 was the ""most violent year ever recorded by the United Nations in Afghanistan."" Security incidents have risen over 60% in the first three months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, the report said.

Govt Asks Regional Nations for Oxygen as COVID-19 Crisis Mounts
","
Acting Minister of Public Health Wahid Majroh on Thursday said that over 50 percent of hospitalized COVID-19 patients need oxygen, as cases rise across the country.
Majroh said the domestic oxygen production firms do not have the capacity to address the needs of the country’s hospitals to provide oxygen, and Afghanistan will ask regional nations for help with the oxygen shortage.
“We are stepping up to a critical stage in Afghanistan; one of the reasons that the scale of the crisis has expanded in Afghanistan is due to the shortage of oxygen,” said Majroh.
“We pleaded for oxygen for our patient and then oxygen was provided by doctors,” said Mujtaba, a patient’s visitor.
“He had a fever and was shivering, he also had asthma and he lacked oxygen,” said Mahmoud, a patient's visitor.
Majroh said there are around seven medical oxygen-producing factories in Afghanistan which cannot address the needs of the country’s health system.
“Our countrymen are making a joke of wearing a facemask, they cite school closures to blame us, therefore Afghanistan requests neighboring countries to support Afghanistan in the delivery of oxygen,” added Majroh.
UNICEF had pledged to establish oxygen production firms at Afghanistan’s hospitals by March, but the Afghan Health Ministry says that it has failed to deliver on its promises.
Latest COVID-19 figures in Afghanistan:
The Ministry of Public Health on Thursday reported 1,509 new positive cases of COVID-19 out of 4,392 samples tested in the last 24 hours.  
The ministry also reported 34 deaths and 107 recoveries from COVID-19 in the same period.
Waheed Majroh, the acting minister of public health, speaking at a press conference in Kabul on Thursday said: “We will face a disaster soon if people don't pay attention to the health advice of the Ministry of Public Health. Creating health centers and increasing beds is not the solution” to fight COVID-19.
“We are faced with a lack of oxygen,” Majroh said. “We are trying to control the situation and supply oxygen (to hospitals) in Kabul and Mazar.”
“People must wear masks. People should stay at home for two weeks, especially those who don’t need to go out for urgent work,” he added.
The new cases were reported in Kabul (557), Kandahar (69), Herat (28), Balkh (172), Nangarhar (82), Takhar (154), Kunduz (123), Faryab (30), Paktia (21), Maidan Wardak (55), Badakhshan (36), Kapisa (43), Laghman (6), Bamiyan (7), Ghazni (34), Zabul (14), Ghor (4), Uruzgan (3), Farah (18), Khost (2), Paktika (17) and Nuristan (2) provinces.

Mohammad Younus Qanooni, the former vice president of Afghanistan at the same event warned that Afghanistan would slip into a new crisis if government leaders do not come up with the necessary reforms in the government to save the gains the nation has made in the past two decades.
“There are serious differences,” said Abdullah, referring to the differences between Afghan political leaders.
“There is a need to find systemic solutions for the questions that come from the public—so, ultimately, with the support of the people this ship (political system) is saved from a possible collapse,” said Abdullah.
“If our government leaders do not endorse reforms and do not accept the ground realities of the Afghan society or do not accept the demands of the Afghan people and continue the work without a national policy, then there is the possibility for a collapse in Afghanistan,” said Qanooni.
The statements come as the Afghan government has so far failed to form the much-anticipated State Supreme Council, in which influential Afghan political leaders are expected to serve as members.
Political leaders have said that members of the council have strong disagreements with President Ashraf Ghani on the authority of the council.
“The crisis of distrust that arises from within the system is the factor that will lead the government to collapse--before the system collapses from any external factors,” said Qanooni.
“Before we address our issues with the Taliban, we need to address the issues on those fronts where we are already fighting--on our own Republic side, where we chant the slogan of the Republic,” said Assadullah Saadati, the deputy head of High Council of National Reconciliation.
“The Supreme State Council is the demand of all people,” said Nazir Ahmadzai, adviser to President Ashraf Ghani.
“A gentleman has sat in the Arg (Presidential Palace) and portrayed his friends as national personalities—sometimes he brings Fazli and sometimes Mohib—it is good that they are your friends--congratulations to you!--because they are your aides. But on what basis can you ask them to sit down with Ustad Sayyaf?” said Abdul Hafiz Mansour, a member of the peace negotiating team representing the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in the talks with the Taliban.
Politicians believe that the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan, and also the political division between leaders, has emboldened the Taliban in its hopes to take power by military means.
Supporters of the republic system and former Afghan mujahideen leaders have said that they will not allow the Taliban to take over power militarily.

EU Special Envoy Seeks End to Violence in Afghanistan
","
Violence must stop and peace talks should move from procedures to substantial negotiations, the European Union's new special envoy Tomas Niklasson said on Friday, reaffirming continued support the Afghan people and the government.  
“As the troops are withdrawing, the EU’s intention is to stay in Afghanistan - continuing our support to the people,” he said. “The violence must stop and the peace talks must move from discussions on procedures to substantial negotiations. I would be happy the day sanctions on the Taliban could be lifted. For that to happen we need to see significant progress in the peace process and a stop to violence.” 
Talking to TOLOnews, the EU special envoy said that he has grave concerns over a dramatic surge in the level of civilian casualties. 
“Our first call is on a comprehensive and immediate ceasefire,” he said. “And that is not because it is in our interest, it is because we see Afghans—all Afghans suffering, that is one thing and that is first thing, but the second thing is that by reducing the level of violence, by agreeing on a ceasefire, you signal a commitment, you signal that you are serious, you show to the people that you care about them and you care about the future.”  
The EU envoy said that he will travel to Pakistan and Qatar to garner support for the Afghan peace process.  
“The EU is ready to continue its engagement with the Afghan people and with the Afghan government, but it is an opportunity for the Afghan people now to come together to leadership, to leave narrow interests behind them and to raise up to the occasion,” he said. 
He asked the Afghan government to fight against corruption and deliver on its promises towards human rights and children's rights. 
“The EU is ready to continue its cooperation as a reliable partner, but we expect that the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan will respect its international commitments, its commitments to the rights of women, its commitments to the rights of children and to continue to fight corruption,” he said. 
The calls for an end to violence comes as fighting continues on multiple fronts between Afghan forces and the Taliban.  
In a latest incident of violence, Mina Khairi, a presenter at Ariana News, and her mother are among the victims of Thursday afternoon’s blast in Kabul that killed four people, the head of the Ariana News, Sharif Hassanyar, confirmed. 
In western Afghanistan, four security force members including Shafiq Jahid, acting police chief for Farsi district in Herat were killed in a Taliban attack on an outpost in Farsi district on Thursday night, the provincial governor Waheed Qatali said.

Rabbani Criticizes Government’s Policy on Peace, Urges Consensus
","
The Afghan government needs to build a strong consensus around peace to move the process forward, said Salahuddin Rabbani, the head of the main faction of Jamiat-e-Islami Afghanistan, criticizing that so far, no constructive step has been taken to expedite the reconciliation efforts. 
Citing division among mainstream political leaders, Rabbani said the key solution to move forward is to overcome the rifts and promote consensus around peace. 
Rabbani, who is a major critic of President Ghani’s administration, said “certain individuals” have “monopolized” the peace process, impeding its progress. 
“Some people take the continuation of war as a mission and as an objective while some others see it as a tool to continue their grip on power and the privileges that are originated from the war. Therefore, if they chant the slogan of peace, in action, they make plans for war,” said Rabbani. 
The remarks come as the Presidential Palace has expedited its efforts to form the State Supreme Council as an initial step to strengthen consensus around peace. 
Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the High Council for National Reconciliation, said the council will act as a decision-maker authority on national issues and Afghanistan’s foreign policy. 
“The council must be a council that would have decision-making authority about the country’s foreign policy and national security affairs,” Abdullah said at the same event. 
“The government is not sincere when it comes to creating the council,” Senate Deputy Speaker Mohammad Alam Ezedyar said. “The government has no commitment to granting authority to the council.” 
The lack of consensus among the country’s political leaders has created concerns about the future of the peace efforts as Abdullah Abdullah on Thursday said the system will collapse if Afghan leaders do not forge a consensus on the issues of national importance.
The Supreme State Council was expected to hold its first meeting this week, but differences on the number of its members, the authorities and the mandate of the council have delayed the formation of the council. 
According to sources familiar with the matter, the council will have 21 members, including four women.

Afghan MoFA to Pakistani Officials: World Knows About ‘Spoilers’
","
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) on Friday reacted to recent remarks by Pakistani officials, including Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, saying that the world knows who has really continued the war in Afghanistan to keep its pace and that blaming will not prove helpful at this critical juncture.
Qureshi in a virtual speech to the European parliament this week said that there are people within Afghanistan who want to disrupt the peace process in the country.
Again in his meeting with Tajikistan’s President Emomali Rahmon this week in Islamabad, Qureshi repeated his allegation, stating that there are people inside the country who try to disrupt peace.
“(There are people) inside and outside Afghanistan who do not want peace and security. We should be vigilant of such spoilers,” said Qureshi.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the spoilers of peace are those who have rejected the Afghan people and the international community’s call by continuing violence.
Blaming will not prove constructive at this sensitive juncture and peace in Afghanistan that is in favor of countries in the region, especially Pakistan, cannot be ensured by issuing statements and remarks, the ministry said.
The Afghan people and the international community seek practical steps by Pakistan for starting meaningful peace negotiations, the foreign ministry said.
“The recent statement by Pakistan’s foreign minister is a clear act of interference in Afghanistan’s internal affairs,” said Nematullah Karyab, an MP.
“Pakistan has always pursued a disruptive policy towards peace in Afghanistan,” said Aziz Mairaj, a former Afghan diplomat.
“Their recent statements are a reaction to the recent speech by the president in which he asked Pakistan to choose one path or option,” said freelance journalist Sami Yousufzai.
This comes a day after Foreign ministers from Afghanistan, Pakistan and China an online trilateral meeting on peace in Afghanistan, during which the Chinese foreign minister said that the Afghan peace process has entered into a crucial phase.
Wang Yi said that the withdrawal of US foreign forces from Afghanistan will complicate the situation in Afghanistan.
The Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs described the meeting as an important step towards strengthening peace in Afghanistan.

Pakistan Seeks Afghan Settlement Before Troop Withdrawal: Report
","
Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has said that his country is pushing for a political settlement in Afghanistan before international troops leave later this year to reduce the risk of civil war in its western neighbor.
US President Joe Biden announced in April to withdraw all American troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11. The announcement was followed by concerns about the political future of Afghanistan.
Pentagon officials have said that one-quarter of the withdrawal has been completed. The US forces have handed some bases to Afghan forces, including the New Kabul Compound, known as NKC, in Kabul.
“There is a lot of fear right now in Pakistan and I assure you that we are trying our level best that there is some sort of political settlement before the Americans leave,” Khan said in an interview with Reuters on Friday.
Violence has remained high in Afghanistan despite a three-day ceasefire from May 13 to May 15 during the Eid days. Security officials reported clashes between government forces and the Taliban in at least 10 provinces on Friday.
“Since the moment the Americans gave a date, of when they were going to leave Afghanistan ... the Taliban feel they have won the war,” Khan said as quoted by Reuters.
He added that it is not going to be easy to get concessions from the Taliban after the US decision.
The peace negotiations in Doha have had no progress following the US announcement of withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan. The majority of the Afghan Republic negotiators returned to Doha last week with the hope to resume the stalled talks with the Taliban.
Khan said Pakistan would suffer the most, after Afghanistan itself, if there was civil war and a refugee crisis.
“And then there would be pressure on us to jump in and become a part of it,” Khan said as quoted by Reuters.
He said his government had changed Pakistan’s decades-long policy of pushing for “strategic depth” in Afghanistan to ensure that there was a friendly government there.
President Ashraf Ghani on various occasions last month reiterated that it is time for Pakistan to choose its path when it comes to its relations with Afghanistan, stressing the need for Islamabad’s practical steps to support the Afghan reconciliation process.
Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in a virtual speech to the European parliament last week said that there are people within Afghanistan who want to disrupt the peace process in the country.
Meanwhile, in his meeting with Tajikistan’s President Emomali Rahmon last week in Islamabad, Qureshi repeated his allegation, stating that there are people inside the country who try to disrupt peace.

Qureshi Strongly Reacts to Afghan NSA Mohib’s Remarks

Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi harshly reacted to recent remarks by Afghan National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib and said it will harm the efforts to forge peace talks with the Taliban but reiterated that such statements will not impact Kabul-Islamabad ties. 
“Today, I am saying it out loud. Listen to me closely,” Qureshi said at a gathering on Saturday, calling out the Afghan NSA: “Pakistan has paid a high price, we have transferred coffins on our shoulders. We are talking about peace, we are talking about stability, but the words that you are using--you are putting the blame on Pakistan, I, as the Foreign Minister of Pakistan, am telling you that if you do not stop such remarks, no conscientious Pakistani will shake hands with you or talk with you.” 
On May 13, Mohib during a trip to the eastern province of Kandahar criticized Pakistan, saying that Pakistan--by supporting a power-mongering group--is expanding its territory in Afghanistan.
“Today our neighbor, whose evil goals are evident to Afghans and the world, is using a power-mongering group to once again weaken Afghanistan, and to once again gain more territory, which it cannot. And if it cannot do anything, it would own the part that was used as a tribal area and would remove the tribal people,” Mohib said on May 13. 
Qureshi, meanwhile, defended Pakistan’s role in Afghan peace by mentioning the recent trip to Kabul by the Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and other high-ranking officials.
“Imran Khan goes to Kabul for peace, Gen. Bajwa goes to Kabul for peace, the ISI chief goes to Kabul for peace, the foreign minister goes to Kabul for peace, and you are comparing Pakistan to a ‘brothel house'? You should be ashamed, and you should regret your words.”
Quoting diplomatic sources, VOA last month reported that Pakistan has stopped its official contacts with Mohib.

Watchdog Seeks Probe into Targeted Attacks on Hazara Community
","
The Afghanistan Human Rights Commission, relying on its assessments about some recent terrorist attacks in Kabul, says that the Hazara community in Afghanistan are prone to “genocide,” reiterating that such targeted killings require comprehensive and deep investigation by an international team that should be picked by the UN.
Since mid-May, at least five attacks have been conducted in Kabul in which majority of the victims were from the Hazara community, including the attack on Sayed al-Shuhada High School in west of Kabul that killed over 90 people, almost all of them students, two blasts that targeted city buses in west of Kabul on Tuesday and two explosions in the west of Kabul on Thursday that targeted a corolla vehicle and a minivan, killing nine civilians, all from the same community.
“Our assessments showed that the Shia and Hazara community in Afghanistan are exposed to genocide and this requires more investigation,” the chairperson of the commission, Shahrzad Akbar, said. “That’s why our statement called for a probe team or an international probe commission.”
She added: “In recent days, we were busy in seeking justice so that an international probe team would visit Afghanistan.”
Meanwhile, a hashtag of “#StopHazaraGenocide” is rounding on social media platforms over the last two days in which social media users from within and outside the country cite recent attacks, show solidarity to each other, call for thorough probe into them and say they cannot affect the unity among Afghans. 
“Our passengers are dropped out of the car and are killed. They are killed at schools. Our children are killed. It is in fact a genocide. We have to raise our voice,” said Musa Khan Reja, an artist.
“They should pay attention that I, as a Pashtun, am a supporter of my Hazara brother and will never allow the enemy to create rupture between us by such terrorist attacks,” said Khalid Noora, an activist. 
On one of Thursday’s blasts, three members of one family, all women, including a TV anchor, were killed, and five more were wounded. One of them, a young girl, died of her wounds at a hospital in Kabul early hours of Sunday as her relatives described. 
“Please, please, prevent such attacks so that the people live with calm… Everyone is tired,” said Zabihullah Nawabi, an artist.
Figures by some sources show that at least 560 people have been killed in 14 attacks on Hazara community in Afghanistan in the last five years. Most of these attacks are suicide bombings and bomb blasts, many in the west of Kabul.

As the level of violence remains high in the country despite occasional efforts to jumpstart the stalled peace process, details provided by a security official who wished not to be named indicate that 119 people, including 102 security force members, were killed in clashes and security incidents in just two days--June 3 and 4. 
Analysts say this shows the gravity of the intensifying conflict. The Defense Ministry reports clashes in at least 10 provinces daily on average. 
The information by the source shows that 196 security force members were wounded onJune 3 and 4. The source says that Taliban casualties are similar to those of Afghan forces in the same time period, but the Defense Ministry reported that 183 Taliban were killed in Afghan defensive operations in eight provinces on June 3, and 181 Taliban were killed in Afghan forces operations in six provinces on June 4. 
According to the source, 54 people, including 17 police force members, 3 supportive local police forces, 20 army members, 5 NDS personnel and 8 civilians were killed on June 3.  
The information indicates that 65 people, including 15 police officers, 23 army members, 5 NDS personnel, 18 members of public uprising forces and 9 civilians were killed on June 4.
The Taliban rejected both figures. 
“There are clashes in 24 to 27 provinces every day. Security forces casualties have increased, but it is not as much as the Taliban,” said Khan Agha Rezaee, the head of the internal security commission of the Wolesi Jirga, the lower house of Parliament. 
“The war leadership is faced with problems and meanwhile there aren't enough forces for the clearance and retaking of areas,” said Nasim Mudabir, an MP from Baghlan. 
The clashes have intensified on multiple fronts as heavy fighting was reported in Faryab in the last 24 hours in which at least a dozen security force members were killed, a member of the provincial council said. 
“The figures provided by Afghan forces on Taliban casualties and by the Taliban on Afghan forces casualties are not accurate,” said Ilyas Wahdat, former Paktika governor.  
The information by the source indicates that 17 civilians were killed on June 3 and 4 and 55 more were wounded. 
“Last week the Taliban martyred 63 civilians in 27 provinces and wounded 126 others. Women and children are also among the victims,” said Rahmatullah Andar, spokesman for the National Security Council.

In Herat, Pashton Zarghon, Zenda Jan and Kohsan districts also witnessed attacks by the Taliban in the past two days, according to local officials. 
“We have warned the government that the outcome of this would be bad and the insecurity in the district is threatening the security of Herat city,” said Wakil Ahmad Karokhi, a member of the provincial council. 
Civilians have been harmed in the fighting in the western parts of the country.  
During recent attacks in Badghis, at least 11 civilians--including women and children--were killed in a roadside mine blast. 
No group including the Taliban has claimed responsibility for the blast.

Taliban Assures Afghan Interpreters on Their Safety
","
Amidst foreign troops withdrawal, thousands of Afghan interpreters and staff members have expressed concerns about threats against them, but the Taliban in a statement said on Monday that the Afghans can continue their normal life, and that they will not face any threat. 
“The Islamic Emirate will not perturb them but calls them to return to their normal lives and if they do have expertise, in any filed, to sever their country. They shall not be in a danger on our port,” a statement by Taliban reads.
The Taliban said that those Afghans who worked with international troops should not fear and should continue living a peaceful life in their own country.
“If they are using the danger as an excuse to bolster their fake asylum case, then that is their own problem,” Taliban said.
US President Joe Biden announced in April to withdraw all American troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11. The announcement was followed by concerns about the political future of Afghanistan.
As US and NATO troops continue withdrawing from Afghanistan, dozens of Afghan workers who have partnered with foreigners over the past 20 years are concerned about the situation and are seeking protection.      
Concerned about the approach of September 11 - the deadline for all foreign troops to leave Afghanistan – these translators and employees said their lives would face serious threats after all foreign troops including France leave the country.      
The workers say that staying in Afghanistan is like a nightmare for them because they receive constant threats because they worked with coalition forces.   
Meanwhile, another group of Afghans who have worked with Canadian forces in Afghanistan gathered in front of the Canadian embassy in Kabul and called on the Canadian government and the United Nations to help them find asylum in Western countries as foreign troops, including Canadians, are leaving the country by September 11.   
The translators and employees, who were employed by the Canada forces in Afghanistan, said they have been repeatedly threatened with death and will not be able to live in Afghanistan after the complete withdrawal of foreign troops.  
Thousands of Afghans have worked with foreign forces in Afghanistan as translators and workers since the coalition forces came to Afghanistan in  2001. The exact number of these locally-employed staff is not available.
Afghan translators and other employees who have worked with foreign forces in Afghanistan have been threatened by various groups for cooperating with these forces. Dozens have lost their lives while hundreds have been wounded. 
Recently, the United States government announced that it would provide special immigrant visas to 18,000 Afghan translators and their families who backed US missions during the past 20 years.

CIA Looks to Afghan Neighbors to Support US Mission: Report
","
The New York Times on Sunday published a report outlining the CIA's struggle to put together a new counterterrorism strategy as US troops withdraw from Afghanistan. ""The CIA is seeking ways to maintain its intelligence-gathering, war-fighting and counterterrorism operations in the country,"" The New York Times reported, citing CIA analysts warning of the ""ever-growing risks"" of a Taliban takeover. 
The report focused on Pakistan, saying ""the CIA used a base there for years to launch drone strikes against militants in the country’s western mountains, but was kicked out of the facility in 2011, when US relations with Pakistan unraveled. 
Any deal now would have to work around the uncomfortable reality that Pakistan’s government has long supported the Taliban.""
The Times article stated that discussions are ongoing over the use of Pakistan for more bases:
   
""In discussions between American and Pakistani officials, the Pakistanis have demanded a variety of restrictions in exchange for the use of a base in the country, and they have effectively required that they sign off on any targets that either the CIA or the military would want to hit inside Afghanistan, according to three Americans familiar with the discussions.""
  
The Times reported that US diplomats are exploring the possibility of establishing US bases in the region with former Soviet republics, but expect that Russia's President Vladimer Putin would oppose this. 
Citing ""several people familiar with the assessments,"" the Times report said that recent CIA and military intelligence reports on Afghanistan have been ""increasingly pessimistic"" and have ""highlighted gains by the Taliban and other militant groups in the south and east, and warned that Kabul could fall to the Taliban within years and return to becoming a safe haven for militants bent on striking the West."" 
William J. Burns, the CIA director, told US senators in April: “When the time comes for the US military to withdraw, the US government’s ability to collect and act on threats will diminish,” adding: “That is simply a fact.” 
The CIA head visited Islamabad, Pakistan in recent weeks to meet with the chief of the Pakistani military and the head of the directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence, but a CIA spokeswoman declined to comment when asked about Burns’s travel to Pakistan, said The Times. 
According to ""American officials familiar with the conversations,"" The Times reported, ""Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III has had frequent calls with the Pakistani military chief about getting the country’s help for future US operations in Afghanistan.""  
The report noted that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke this month with his counterpart in Tajikistan, ""though it is not clear if base access was discussed during the call.""

Khalilzad: ‘Continuous War’ if No Afghan Political Settlement
","
US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, currently on a regional tour amid the withdrawal of American and coalition forces from Afghanistan, says two options remain for Afghanistan at this critical juncture: A political solution to the conflict or continued war. He reiterated that the United States will not abandon Afghanistan despite US troops leaving. 
In his first interview with TOLOnews after the start of the troop withdrawal, Khalilzad said on Monday that attempting a military solution will result in a continued war, while also acknowledging that the peace process in Doha has been slow and that both sides of the negotiations have not focused on the main issues. 
Khalilzad is accompanied by an interagency US delegation, and upon its arrival the group held separate meetings with President Ashraf Ghani and HCNR Chairman Abdullah Abdullah, focusing on the new chapter in Kabul-Washington ties as well as discussing region’s role in the peace process. 
The Taliban recently floated a request for the release of 7,000 more prisoners by the Afghan government as well as the removal of their leaders’ names from the blacklist, as catalysts to renew the peace efforts. But Khalilzad said these two conditions are not practical given the current circumstances in which violence remains high in the country. 
Khalilzad said that the Taliban has not responded to a US plan for Afghanistan’s future after it was shared with them, and they have not returned a plan in response to the United States. 
“Some Taliban negotiators, including their chief negotiator Shaikh Hakim, went to Quetta and had some discussions, and have returned now and say they are interested in the resumption of the talks in the near future, and that they might submit their plan to the Republic delegation,” Khalilzad said.
The Ministry of Defense reports clashes between Afghan forces and Taliban in more than 10 provinces on a daily basis, and analysts say there is no clear information about the progress of the peace talks. 
Indirectly acknowledging the high level of violence, Khalilzad warned that the continuation of fighting after the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan will open the way for regional interferences in the country. 
“There are two ways in a long-term perspective: Either there should be a political agreement or there would be a continued war. And God forbid, if an endless war happens, interferences in Afghanistan’s affairs by the region might increase, and this is not in Afghanistan’s favor,” Khalilzad said. 
Recently, some districts have been either “evacuated” or security forces have made “tactical retreats,” including two districts on Sunday--one in Uruzgan and the other in Ghor-- increasing the challenges faced by Afghan forces to maintain morale. 
Concerning the fate of the Afghan army after all foreign troops pullout, Khalilzad in Monday's interview said “some among the Taliban” are “proud of” Afghanistan’s army, a statement which contrasts a remark by Taliban’s former chief negotiator Abbas Stanekzai who in 2019 spoke about “dissolving” Afghan army once the group takes power. Stanekzai's remarks were at the height of the group's talks with US negotiators that led to the signing of the Doha agreement. 
Khalilzad said there was now an army that ""did not exist some years back when the US came in, a national army that we are also proud of ... believe me, even some Taliban are proud of it and said 'don’t let this army be dismantled."" 
However, the Taliban's former chief negotiator said the following around that time:
“This is not our national army. An army would defend Afghanistan’s borders, defend against the enemy. This army is under the control of the enemy itself… When the Americans leave, their payments will end and they will be ended too,” Abbas Stanekzai said in February 2019.
In response to a question on the legacy of the US war in Afghanistan, which cited the scrapped equipment by American forces outside Bagram Airfield and the deadly attack on a school in the west of Kabul as indicators that would challenge a US narrative of success, Khalilzad said these does not tell the whole story of the US’s legacy in the country. 
“This is a tiny and limited part of the history or the legacy – as you mentioned – of the US presence in Afghanistan. I want to say that the US troops are leaving but the US is not leaving Afghanistan. A strong relationship will continue, but I see other things, too, as the legacy of the US presence in Afghanistan. I see TOLO (TV) as a legacy of freedom of speech,” Khalilzad said. “It was made after the US presence, a new system was established, a new environment was created. I see a large number of girls going to schools, I see universities full of students, I see the extension of life expectancy among Afghans, I see the youth who show their skills, the institutions that have been built, the improvement that has been achieved.” 
Khalilzad said that the United States will stand with Afghan security forces until peace is established in the country, and cited the $3.3 billion that the Biden administration put in the proposed Pentagon budget for Afghanistan in 2022.
Khalilzad said he is accompanied by a team from various agencies that will meet with the Afghan government about the transfer of responsibility as American troops withdraw, as well as issues following withdrawal including peace and economic and security cooperation.

MPs Question Transport Minister on Fuel Tanker Fires
","
Lawmakers in the Wolesi Jirga, the lower house of Parliament, on Sunday aggressively questioned the transport minister on the string of recent fuel tankers fires and accused him of “illegal” appointments in the ministry.
Transport Minister Qudratullah Zaki, who is an aide to Abdul Rashid Dostum, was asked about the Herat fire that occurred in mid-February and destroyed hundreds of fuel trucks, the fire at a border town in Farah, and the fire at a fuel tankers' station in Kabul on May 1 that killed nine people. He was also questioned about his “repeated” failure to appear before Parliament, and his recent appointments in the Ministry of Transport.
The legislators sought a vote to disqualify the minister and remove him from his post, but this did not happen due to a lack of quorum. This was followed by a heated debate in which MPs accused each other of favoritism in the summoning of ministers.
“Every position is sold, a deal is made… at the Ministry of Transport some have been beaten up,” said Abbas Ibrahimzada, an MP from Balkh.
“Two thousand vehicles were burned. They were not owned by any lawmaker, that’s why they are not raising their voice. 40,000 families were supported by those 2,000 vehicles,” said Khalid Asad, an MP from Paktika.
The lawmakers said there is a need for balance when it comes to the summoning of cabinet ministers.
“The ministries have been accused of embezzlement repeatedly, but this ministry has not received any blame. Why has this person (minister) been summoned?” asked Habiba Danesh, an MP from Takhar.
“We will stand with you if the transport minister has violated the lawmakers’ request, but we request that you do not play favorites,” said Khan Agha Rezaee, an MP from Kabul.
The transport minister rejected the allegations against him and said that according to their agreement with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Transport has no role in stopping tanker trucks carrying fuel and other goods outside the Kabul gates or at border towns.
“Our income is collected through a proper system. We have received a clear warning that the employees of the Transport Ministry have no right to stop trucks,” Zaki said.

Lawmakers to Summon Security Chiefs as Violence Surges

The Wolesi Jirga, the lower house of Parliament, will summon security chiefs following an increase in Afghan forces casualties on the battlefield and the fall of some district centers and outposts to the Taliban.
Calling the country’s security situation fragile, some MPs said that the rise in insecurity has created grave concerns among the people and they will ask security chiefs to review their security plans.
The centers of Burka district in Baghlan, Narkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak, Dawlat Shah district in Laghman, Qaisar district in Faryab, Shahrak district in Ghor and Shirzad district in Uruzgan have fallen to the Taliban in less than two months.
The Taliban claims they have also captured Charkh district in Logar, Do Ab and Mandol districts in Nuristan, Farsi district in Herat, Deh Yak district in Ghazni, Gezab district in Daikundi and Shinkai district in Zabul.
“Our martyrs are on the ground, but no institution takes action to even collect them,” said Fatima Kohistani, an MP from Ghor.
“Districts have fallen one after another. The security situation is deteriorating,” said Tarakhil Mohammadi, an MP.
The parliament speaker, Mir Rahman Rahmani, said that Taliban does not believe in peace and that the war strategy and plans against them should be reviewed.
“The defense and security commissions are assigned to summon security and defense chiefs,” Rahmani said.
Clashes are underway between security forces and the Taliban in at least 20 provinces. At least 10 security force members have been killed and five more have been wounded in the clashes in five provinces in the last 24 hours, according to sources.
The Ministry of Defense said that 126 Taliban were killed and 80 more were wounded in clashes in the last 24 hours. The Taliban has rejected these figures.

NATO Chief Vows Continued Support to Afghans Despite Withdrawal
","
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says the alliance is ending its military mission in Afghanistan, but it is not ending its support for Afghans, reiterating that they are looking into ways “to preserve our hard-won gains” in the country. 
“At the same time, of course, we’re also looking into the future. And addressing how can we preserve our hard-won gains in Afghanistan,” Stoltenberg said, mentioning that “we are withdrawing our troops in a coordinated way” 
The NATO chief said that the alliance will continue “funding Afghan forces.” 
“We will also look into how we can provide out-of-country training to train the Afghan forces, especially their special operation forces outside Afghanistan,” he said at an event on Monday hosted by the Atlantic Council.  
Stoltenberg added: “We’re also working on how can we maintain some critical infrastructure, as for instance, the airport, to also support the presence of the broader international community, diplomatic presence, but also development aid and so on. So NATO will continue to be committed to Afghanistan, but in another way than over the last two decades with a big military operation.”  
The withdrawal of international troops from Afghanistan started on May 1, something that was accompanied by concerns about the country’s political future and whether the achievements of the last two decades will be maintained. 
Stoltenberg assured that NATO will have a civilian presence in Afghanistan, helping Afghan forces with capacity building, and so on at the ministerial level or for the different security institutions. 
The NATO chief said that there is “a lot of uncertainty” in Afghanistan and “it’s a very difficult situation.” 
“We had several ministerial meetings, we had many meetings at the ambassadorial level in Brussels. So we consulted, but of course, it was a difficult decision to end the military mission which we had for almost two decades,” Stoltenberg said.

UN Report Cites New Info on Taliban-Al Qaeda Ties
","
A new report by a UN monitoring team says that the Taliban and Al Qaeda “remain closely aligned and show no indication of breaking ties.”
The UN report says that UN member states “report no material change to this relationship, which has grown deeper as a consequence of personal bonds of marriage and shared partnership in struggle, now cemented through second generational ties.”
Long War Journal said that other findings by the UN are consistent with previous analyses prepared by the UN Security Council’s Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, however, the most recent report cites new intelligence as well.
One claim noted by analysts is that Sirajuddin Haqqani, the deputy emir of the Taliban’s Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, is also a member of Al Qaeda’s leadership.
“If the terrorism threat rises once again in Afghanistan or if a threat emerges to US national security from Afghanistan, in that case we want to have forces in the region to respond--to defend US national security and show a reaction,” US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said in an interview with TOLOnews on Monday.
This intelligence information was cited in a footnote, which states that in addition to being a Taliban leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani “is also assessed to be a member of the wider Al Qaeda leadership, but not of the Al Qaeda core leadership (the Hattin Shura),” the Long War Journal noted.
The UN report does not make it clear what position Sirajuddin is thought to hold within Al Qaeda’s “wider"" leadership, said the Long War Journal.
“Al Qaeda threats will not be the same as in 2001 for few years ahead,” former interior minister Gen. Massoud Andarabi said.
The Taliban did not comment on TOLOnews' questions about the claims, but previously they have rejected reports by UN monitoring teams.
“I think a (shared) interest would be in ... war affairs, or Afghanistan affairs or in fighting foreigners. I don’t think (the two groups) are united with these,” said former Taliban commander Akbar Agha.
In 2019, the Al Qaeda leader in a message mentioned Sirajuddin Haqqani and Hibatullah Akhundzada as “our leaders from the Islamic emirate of Afghanistan” and expressed gratitude for the selection of Haqqani as the deputy leader of the Taliban.

As Districts Fall, Govt Blasted for Inadequate Security Strategy
","
Lawmakers and analysts on Tuesday criticized the government’s security strategy following the fall of two new districts to the Taliban in the last 24 hours. Complaints included the alleged failure of Afghan forces to fight in an offensive mode, and for failing to supply provisional outposts.
The centers of Jaghato and Band Ab districts in Ghazni, and Dawlat Abad district in Faryab, have fallen to the Taliban in the last 24 hours, according to provincial council members and local sources. However, the Defense Ministry has said that these areas were ""evacuated"" or that security forces ""retreated to protect civilians.""
Sources said that 17 districts have fallen to the Taliban in the last two months.
“We are concerned about Muqur and Rashidan districts (in Ghazni), which are under siege. Security forces sustained high casualties in Muqur,” said Arif Rahmani, an MP from Ghazni.
The centers of Burka district in Baghlan, Narkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak, Dawlat Shah district in Laghman, Qaisar district in Faryab, Shahrak district in Ghor and Shirzad district in Uruzgan have fallen to the Taliban in less than two months.
The Taliban claims they have also captured Charkh district in Logar, Do Ab and Mandol districts in Nuristan, Farsi district in Herat, Deh Yak district in Ghazni, Gezab district in Daikundi and Shinkai district in Zabul.
“You are busy on districts. Provinces will fall after 10 to 15 days. Many provinces are under siege. They do not receive equipment and facilities and security forces are not observing their leaves; their wounded and martyrs are not being transferred… They have no option but to leave,” said Hashim Alokozai, the head of the defense commission of the Senate.
“It has been proven that being on the defensive is not active. The government should change the method of war and should go into an offensive mode, rather than defensive,” said Hayatullah Elmi, an MP from Samangan.
Former interior minister Gen. Massoud Andarabi said there is a need to pay more attention to the peace process at this critical juncture.
“If we put everything on the security sector, it will be difficult for them to get out of the situation,” Andarabi said.
Ordinary Afghans commented that the government has failed to provide support to security forces in some areas.
“Twenty districts have fallen but the government is silent and is not addressing anything. We call on the government to find a fundamental solution,” said Mir Salamuddin, a Kabul resident.
“The government does not have a plan for our security forces who are martyred every day,” said Mohammad Kabir, a Kabul resident.
Sources from security agencies said Taliban casualties on the battlefield are higher than those of Afghan forces, but some sources tell TOLOnews that the security forces casualties are nearly 100 each day.
“Security forces have comprehensive plans for suppressing the enemy and retaking the areas. Soon you will witness change in those areas,” said Defense Ministry spokesman Rohullah Ahmadzai.

DABS: 23 Power Pylons Destroyed, Damaged in 1 Month
","
The country’s power distributor, Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS), on Tuesday said that 23 electricity pylons have been destroyed or damaged by explosions in just a month's time, raising concerns over the stability of the imported power as many areas now face power outages.
Three power pylons were damaged by explosions over the last day--two in Salang district, Parwan province, and one in Herat province, disrupting the imported power supply from Uzbekistan and Iran in the two provinces.
The damage to power pylons in Salang district disrupted the electricity supply to Kabul and seven other provinces. DABS said the power lines have been partially reconnected. 
Parwan officials said the repair of the two pylons in Salang will take two days. One was damaged partially and the other destroyed.
“The explosion was powerful--it shook homes. Other explosions happened shortly after the first one. Up to five blasts happened,” said Noor-ul-Haq, a resident of Salang.
Two pylons were damaged in the blasts. Four explosions targeted the first pylon while three occurred at the second. One bomb was defused by security forces, according to officials.  
DABS employees said they had arrived at the Ahangaran village in Salang district early on Tuesday morning to repair the pylons, but it is taking time for them to reach the area due to difficult terrain.
“In Parwan, there are four pylons in Salang, four pylons in Jangal Bagh and one pylon in Rabat,” said Rohullah Sajid, head of the energy and water department in Parwan.
The back-to-back attacks on power pylons have ratcheted up fear about the security of the national electricity supply system. DABS officials said security officials have not talked to them about the attack on the pylons.
“Overall, the pylons that have been destroyed or damaged are 25 in total,” said Engineer Ahad, a DABS employee.
Other pylons have been either damaged or destroyed in Kalakan, Shakardara and Qara Bagh districts of Kabul. Daesh claimed responsibility for destroying the towers.
“We arrested three suspects last night. Details will be shared later,” said Mohammad Hamid Niazi, an army commander in Parwan.
Sources in the north accused some within the government of involvement in the attack on the pylons.

India Opens Channels With Taliban Leaders: Report

India for the first time opened channels of communication with Afghan Taliban leaders, including the group's deputy leader Mullah Ghani Baradar, the Hindustan Times reported on Wednesday.  
The report said the move marks “a significant shift” from New Delhi’s position of not engaging with the Taliban in any way.
The outreach is largely being led by Indian security officials and has been limited to Taliban factions and leaders that are perceived as being “nationalist” or outside the sphere of influence of Pakistan and Iran, one of the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.
The communication has been underway for some months, though it continues to be exploratory in nature, sources told the Hindustan Times. 
In the case of Mullah Baradar, the first person cited above said messages were exchanged by the two sides though there was no confirmation of a meeting, the report said. 
There have also been conversations with other Taliban factions despite a lack of trust on both sides, the sources told the Hindustan Times. 
India is the largest regional contributor to Afghanistan’s reconstruction and development efforts with pledges of $3 billion but has lagged behind other regional players such as Russia, China and Iran in establishing contacts with the Taliban, largely because of the group’s long-standing links with the Pakistani military establishment, according to the report. 
“But there has been a huge shift since then and there are some who think it might be better to have a line of communication with some Taliban leaders,” another source told the Hindustan Times.
The people who spoke to the Hindustan Times ""made it very clear that India’s outreach didn’t include the Haqqani Network or members of the Quetta Shura, who are seen as proxies of the Pakistani military."" 
There was no formal response from the Indian government to this report
A visit to Kabul last month by joint secretary JP Singh, the external affairs ministry’s point person for Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran, was part of the continuing engagement with Afghan leaders. “Singh engaged with various groups and made an assessment of the situation on the ground and got a first-hand sense of things,"" a source told the Hindustan Times.

Biden: US Will Not Take 'Eye Off' Terror Threat in Afghanistan
","
US President Joe Biden in a ""letter to certain congressional committees regarding Afghanistan"" on Tuesday said that as American troops pull out “we will not take our eye off the terrorist threat in Afghanistan.” 
“The United States will reorganize our counterterrorism capabilities and assets in the region to prevent the reemergence of a terrorist threat in Afghanistan,” Biden said. “We will hold the Taliban and the Afghan government accountable to their commitments not to allow terrorists to threaten the United States or its allies from Afghan soil.  And we will refine our national strategy to monitor and disrupt terrorist threats wherever they arise.” 
Biden in the letter said that over the past few decades, the US and its partners have trained hundreds of thousands of Afghan troops, adding that the Afghan security force members currently number close to 300,000, and “they will continue to fight valiantly to protect the Afghan citizens.” 
“With the support of the Congress, we will continue to support the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces. We will also continue to support the rights of Afghan women and girls and to maintain significant humanitarian and development assistance to Afghanistan,” he said. 
“We will continue to pursue diplomacy and fully support peace talks between the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban, facilitated by the United Nations.  And we will encourage other nations in the region, especially Pakistan, to do more to support Afghanistan and to support stability in the country,” he said. “But we will not allow United States troops to be a bargaining chip between warring parties in other countries.  That is a recipe for staying indefinitely in Afghanistan.” 
“We will withdraw responsibly, deliberately, and safely, in full coordination with our allies and partners. Our NATO allies and operational partners, who have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with us for almost 20 years and who have also made great sacrifices, will now withdraw alongside our forces as we stand by our enduring principle of “in together, out together,” Biden said. 
On April 14, Biden announced that the US troops will leave Afghanistan by September 11. Biden said he reached this conclusion ""after conducting a rigorous policy review process and consulting closely with our allies and partners, with our military leaders and intelligence personnel, with our diplomats and our development experts, with the Congress and the Vice President, and with the President of Afghanistan and many other leaders around the world.” 
“We went to Afghanistan in 2001 for a clear and just purpose: to apprehend those who attacked our country on September 11, 2001; to root out al-Qa’ida; and to prevent future attacks against the United States from Afghanistan. As a Senator, I supported sending our military to Afghanistan for those reasons. Our original mission had overwhelming support in the Congress and our allies and partners rallied to our side and stood with us in Afghanistan,” he further said. 
“We have long since accomplished the objectives that sent us to Afghanistan. It has been 10 years since we delivered justice to Osama bin Laden. The terrorist threat from al-Qa’ida in Afghanistan is significantly degraded,” he said. 
“Over the last 20 years, however, the terrorist threat to the United States has become more dispersed around the globe. Keeping thousands of troops concentrated on the ground in Afghanistan no longer makes sense as the most effective counterterrorism strategy when the threat has metastasized across the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Our focus and posture need to adapt accordingly,” he added.

","
At least 16 people, including 2 civilians, were killed in the recent attack on the police headquarters in Balkh province, and 117 others, including 67 civilians, were wounded, said Mohammad Younus Stanekzai, the Balkh district governor.
According to local officials, 10 houses and 80 shops were also damaged in the attack.
“Unfortunately, the district building was totally damaged--100 percent--while the police HQ building was also damaged 80 percent,” said Mohammad Younus Stanekzai, the Balkh district governor.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the deadly attack.
TOLOnews’ correspondent Sayed Mohammad Arif Musavi visited the area three days after the attack and said on Wednesday that there are still security threats in the district. 
Musavi painted a grim picture of the attack's aftermath.
“Administrative affairs have been suspended for two days,” said Stanekzai.
Eyewitnesses said that the majority of those killed in the blast were civilians.
“No one is visiting the city and bazaar, they are all afraid,” said Abdul Karim, a resident in Balkh.
The security agencies have so far not commented on how a truck full of explosives managed to reach such a highly secure area.
“Our personnel have been deployed in the area, there is no need to feel fear, everyone can return to their work,” said Zia-ul-Haq Toofan, the commander of the Balkh district police.

Killing of Deminers Sparks Widespread Condemnation
","
The killing of 10 deminers and the wounding of 16 others from the HALO Trust organization by unknown gunmen in northern Baghlan province on Tuesday night has sparked strong international reactions.
  Unknown masked gunmen attacked the organization's office in Baghlan-e-Marzaki district, said a security official who wished not to be named. 
The wounded deminers, along with the bodies of the slain, were transferred to a public hospital in Pul-e-Khumri City, the center of Baghlan.  
Those who survived the attack said “the gunmen had sound suppressors on their weapons and gathered all the workers in one room and started shooting.” 
“There were five attackers and they collected all the workers' phones and money,” said the survivors.  
The EU Special Envoy for Non-proliferation and Disarmament, Marjolijn van Deelen, in a tweet said: “We are shocked by the brutality of this act. This is heart breaking news, may they rest in peace.” 
“Violence must stop,"" said Marjolijn van Deelan, and peace talks must ""move forward to substantial negotiations.""
US Chargé d'Affaires Ross Wilson in a tweet said: “This attack on the HALO Trust mine clearers in Baghlan is horrific and senseless. The United States condemns these killings; humanitarian and aid workers are protected by International Humanitarian Law. I call for an immediate investigation.” 
“Mine clearers are the bravest of the brave. They make Afghanistan a safer place to raise a family, grow a business, build a farm, and enjoy a full life. My condolences go out to the families of the fallen,” he said. 
The European Union's special envoy Tomas Niklasson also said in a tweet: “Humanitarian workers, including those who provide services to Afghans throughout the country, are to be protected under international humanitarian law.” 
“Those who attack humanitarian workers attack their own people and show a complete disregard for Islamic values,” he said. 
The German embassy said on Twitter: “We are deeply shocked and dismayed by the heinous and cowardly attack against the HALO Trust deminers in Baghlan province last night.” 
“This was an attack not only against innocent civilians, but also against brave people who work for all Afghans, reducing the danger mines pose to citizens in many parts of the country,"" it said. “We strongly believe in their work.” 
Ramiz Alakbarov, UN Secretary General's Deputy Special Representative for Afghanistan, issued a statement: “I strongly condemn the heinous attack on the Halo Trust NGO yesterday in Baghlan Province in northern Afghanistan which reportedly killed at least 10 people and injured 16 others.” 
“It is repugnant that an organization that works to clear landmines and other explosives and better the lives of vulnerable people could be targeted,” he said. 
“Aid workers and humanitarian organisations are protected under International Humanitarian Law. We call for a full investigation to ensure that those responsible for any violations are held accountable and brought to justice,” he said. 
HALO Trust, a mine clearance organization, confirmed that 10 of its staff were killed and 16 others were wounded by an unknown armed group at a demining camp in Baghlan province on Tuesday night. 
“Around 110 men from local communities in northern Afghanistan were in the camp having finished their work on nearby minefields,” it said. 
“We strongly condemn the attack on our staff who were carrying out humanitarian work to save lives,” it said. 
The Interior Affairs Ministry's spokesman Tariq Arian blamed the Taliban for the attack.  
The Taliban has denied involvement in the attack, and no other group has claimed responsibility.

ICC, Afghan Govt Investigating Recent Mass Killings
","
The Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) on Wednesday said that the Afghan government and the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague are assessing the recent attacks in Afghanistan that targeted civilians.
Hamid Tahzib, the deputy spokesman of the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on Wednesday said that Afghan Foreign Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar  during his recent trip to Holland raised the issue with prosecutors from The Hague.
Meanwhile, a number of lawmakers in Afghanistan’s Parliament on Wednesday said that the Afghan government has failed to prevent mass killings of the Hazara people, and insisted that these attacks on Hazara people must be considered genocide.
“More than 35 deadly attacks could be considered a genocide; unfortunately, the government did nothing,” said MP Mahdi Rasekh.
“If the government is not able to protect them, then it should seek cooperation from the local community,” said MP Abdul Rauf Enaami.
“It should be determined, which person or which (group) is committing such acts, or who really supports these incidents,” said Zabihullah Farhang, a spokesman for the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission.
“If it is not possible for the government to tackle it at the national level, then there are international courts including the ICC which can work together with the Afghan government regarding this issue,” said MP Nahid Farid.
“Recent terrorist attacks on the students and the civilians are under the joint assessment of the country’s legal and judicial institutions and the International Criminal Court,” said Hamid Tahzib, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
In the past month, western areas in Kabul witnessed a series of deadly attacks on civilian targets including an attack on a girls school in the Dasht-e-Barchi area of Kabul that killed 85 students and wounded 245 more.

MPs Decry Govt's Handling of War, Rising Death Count
","
Lawmakers in Afghanistan’s Wolesi Jirga—the lower house of Parliament--on Wednesday spoke out in alarm over the escalating level of violence—saying the country has changed into a sacrificial altar.
The lawmakers hurled criticism at the security policy of the Afghan security agencies, saying it is suspicious that the centers of districts are falling to the Taliban one after another.
MPs said that if the government plans to hand over the districts to the Taliban, then it should not sacrifice the sons of the nation who serve in the ranks of the country’s security and defense forces.
Meanwhile, MPs said that at least 180 security force members, some of them wounded, were taken hostage by the Taliban in the Qaisar district of Faryab.
“The Jond district in Badghis is one of the districts which fell to the Taliban last night because of a lack of air support,” said MP Farida Nekzad.
“Your youths are being butchered in groups, what is their sin,” said MP Sayed Hassan Sharifi Balkhabi, referring to the casualties among the ANDSF.
“We are being sacrificed each day,” said MP Ziauddin Akazi.
The Taliban claimed they have seized the center of 20 districts across the country in the past two months.
But the Afghan security officials have said that the centers of only 6 districts have fallen to the Taliban.
“The Taliban has had some activity in the past 24 hours, our forces confronted them and their attacks were repelled,” said Rohullah Ahmadzai, a defense ministry spokesman.
“In Qaisar and Dawlat Abad districts over a hundred security force members were taken hostage. Another 80 soldiers were wounded,” said Mir Rahman Rahmani, speaker of the Afghan parliament.
The centers of Barka district in Baghlan, Nerkh and Jalrez in Maidan Wardak, Dawlat Shah district in Laghman, Qaisar in Faryab, Gizab in Uruzgan and Sharak in Ghor have so far fallen to the Taliban.
But the Taliban have claimed to have taken control of centers in Charkh district in Logar, Du Ab and Mandol in Nuristan, Farsi in Herat, Dayak in Ghazni, Shinkai in Zabul and Gizab in Daikundi.

Nimruz Faces Water Crisis Despite Kamal Khan Dam
","
Farmers and residents in the southwestern province of Nimruz have called on the central government to address the lack of water--for household use or to irrigate crops--and say that despite their hopes Kamal Khan Dam has not solved their problems.
They said the lack of water in the country, as well as the rising temperature, has made life difficult in the province. 
Residents of Zaranj, the capital of Nimroz province, need to buy water from tanker trucks at high prices, as the well water in the city is not safe for drinking. 
The residents of Nimroz had hopes that the Kamal Khan Dam would solve their problems, but it has not. In addition to the lack of safe drinking water, they do not have water for irrigation.
“There is no drinking water at all. We have to pay 700 to 800 Afghanis to get water from a 1,000-liter tanker,” said Rahmatullah Rahmani, a resident of Nimroz. 
Tanker owners provide water from deep wells that are far from Zarang city. 
“We do not have water in our house at the moment. We are looking for tankers everywhere. The tankers prefer to sell water to those who pay higher,” said Nimroz resident Mohammad Yousef Barakzai.
“People are facing water shortages and drought this year with the high temperatures of more than 50 degrees,” said Baz Mohammad Naser, chairman of the Nimroz Provincial Council. 
Farmers in Nimroz say their agricultural fields and crops have been destroyed due to lack of water this year, and the Kamal Khan Dam has not helped them to tackle the water shortage problem as they expected. 
They added that the Kamal Khan Dam’s water did not reach their fields.
“Since the day the dam was opened, the water has been lost in Nimruz,” Abdul Jamil Rukhshani, a farmer in Nimruz said. 
“In Nimroz province, no one has had a good growing season, no one has a good Faliz (an area for growing melons). All is gone,” said Mohammad Sarwar, a farmer.
The construction of the Kamal Khan Dam began in the solar year 1345, but due to the war it was delayed. After five decades of waiting, the dam was eventually inaugurated by President Ashraf Ghani on March 24. 
Kamal Khan Dam, which cost $111 million, was built on the Helmand River in the Chahar Burjak district of Nimroz province. It has the capacity to store 52 million cubic meters of water, irrigating more than 170,000 hectares of land, and generating 9 megawatts of electricity. 
Meanwhile, the national water affairs regulation authority says that construction is underway to build six canals at Kamal Khan Dam to supply water to the people of Zaranj city and to agricultural areas.
“The construction of the Kamal Khan Dam is 100 percent complete. At the moment, work on the canals from the dam are underway, which are 65 percent complete,” said Nizamuddin Khpulwak, a spokesman for the national water affairs regulation authority.

Pentagon Mulls Protecting Kabul With Airstrikes: Report
","
The Pentagon is considering whether to intervene with warplanes or drones in the event that Kabul is in danger of falling to the Taliban, though no decisions have been made, The New York Times reported on Wednesday.  
Senior officials told The New York Times that the Pentagon is considering seeking authorization to carry out airstrikes to support Afghan security forces if Kabul or another major city is in danger of falling to the Taliban. 
The report mentioned that Biden and his national security aides had previously suggested that once US troops left Afghanistan, air support would end as well, except for strikes aimed at terrorist groups that could be considered a threat to American interests. 
No decisions have been made yet, officials said,  but ""one option under consideration would be to recommend that US warplanes or armed drones intervene in an extraordinary crisis, such as the potential fall of Kabul, the Afghan capital, or a siege that puts American and allied embassies and citizens at risk,"" according to The Times report. 
President Joe Biden would need to approve additional airstrikes, said The Times, citing officials who added that that such air support would be difficult to maintain over a long period because of the logistical effort already being given to the US troop pullout.   
The United States will leave all its air bases in Afghanistan by next month, and any airstrikes would most likely have to be launched from bases in the Persian Gulf, said The Times. 
""A potential fall of Kabul is the crisis most likely to lead to military intervention after US troops leave, officials said.""
Acting Air Force Secretary John Roth told US lawmakers Tuesday that “over the horizon” strike capabilities for US counterterrorism in Afghanistan--and protection as troops withdraw--will come from existing bases in the region, at least for now, according to media outlet Defense One. 
 ""The Air Force is seeking about $10 billion in the 2022 budget to fund those operations and maintain its footprint to provide the over-the-horizon protection, Roth said. In previous budget cycles, the funds would have likely been added into the overseas contingency operations account, but the Defense Department ended the use of OCO funds this year,"" said Defense One. 
Defense One also reported that at a Center for a New American Security event on Tuesday, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks said that the United States would also provide “over the horizon” support to the Afghan security forces, but that the final shape for all of that support was still being planned. 
Hicks said: “We are working through all of that right now,” Hicks said. “We have to take into account regional aspects and allied approaches. We will have, over the course of this summer, proposals to give to the president in terms of what that over-the-horizon capability should be.” 
“It’s for counterterrorism. It’s not an over-the-horizon capability to do all things, to operate, as the United States was operating in Afghanistan,” Hicks said. 
On April 14, Biden announced that the US troops will leave Afghanistan by September 11. 
Biden in a ""letter to certain congressional committees regarding Afghanistan"" on Tuesday said that as American troops pull out “we will not take our eye off the terrorist threat in Afghanistan.”  
“The United States will reorganize our counterterrorism capabilities and assets in the region to prevent the reemergence of a terrorist threat in Afghanistan,” Biden said. “We will hold the Taliban and the Afghan government accountable to their commitments not to allow terrorists to threaten the United States or its allies from Afghan soil.  And we will refine our national strategy to monitor and disrupt terrorist threats wherever they arise.”

1.4M Afghans Returned From Iran in Past 18 Months: Ministry

Afghanistan’s Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation on Thursday said that 1.4 Afghan refugees have returned to the country from Iran in the past 18 months.
Authorities at the Afghan Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation said that the majority of the returnees were expelled by the Iranian police.
Statistics indicate that each day three to four thousand Afghans return from Iran through the Islam Qala border in Herat.
“There is unemployment and misery in Iran. Iranian police expel (Afghans). Iranian authorities do not help those Afghans who are sick or have other problems, Afghans face lots of issues there,” said Ismail, a returnee.
“I was sick and hardly managed to find a pack of medicine. They were not giving us sufficient food at camps,” said Sahar Gul, an Afghan who has returned from Iran. 
Murtaza is another returnee who was expelled along with her six-year-old child. Three other members of her family were also expelled recently.
“All Afghans go to Iran to find a job, if there is peace in our country, the people will live in peace and comfort, but all people move abroad because of unemployment,” said Murtaza.
“In 2020 we recorded 890,000 returnees from all countries, but the majority had returned from Iran. In 2021, we recorded the return of 490,000 people exclusively from Iran,” said Abdul Basit Ansari, a spokesman for the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation.
“Fighting is underway in Shindand district, 4000 families were recently displaced from the area, no NGO or government supported us, no one takes care of our problems,” said Ghulam Sakhi, a resident in Herat.

The deputy head of the High Council of National Reconciliation (HCNR), Haji Din Mohammad, on Thursday said that there are still serious political differences between the Afghan government and the political leaders about the establishment of the Supreme State Council.
While the government claims that it is continuing its consultations with the Afghan political leaders about the establishment of the council, close aides to former president Hamid Karzai have said that Karzai and Salahuddin Rabbani, the leader of Jamiat-e-Islami (Rabbani faction), aren’t willing to participate in a consultative and symbolic council.
Afghan political leaders have said in the past that the council must have the authority to make decisions on national issues including Afghanistan’s war, peace, and foreign policy.
“Disagreements still persist on the number of its members and its authorities, they have not reached a conclusion so far,” said Haji Din Mohammad.
Based on the documents seen by the media, the members of the council would be Hamid Karzai, the former president, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of Hizb-e-Islami, Salahuddin Rabbani, the head of one faction of Jamiat-e-Islami,  and fifteen other influential political leaders, although some of these leaders have said they are not willing to join if the role of the council does not meet their expectations. 
“No only Mr. Karzai, but I think many other political leaders have decided not to participate because it is meaningless to have a symbolic council,” said Gul Rahman Qazi, a close aide to Karzai.
“Jamiat accepts membership in the council if it would have executive authority, if the council was able to address the issues around peace and war, security and foreign policy,” said Shafiqullah Saighani, a member of Jamiat-e-Islami (Rabbani faction).
“From the day talks started in Doha, no political consensus was forged. The president continues to act in self-interest, he attempts to make the council symbolic, but such a council will not be beneficial to the people,” said MP Abdul Zahir Tamim.
“Consultations are continuing between politicians,” said Latif Mahmoud, a deputy presidential spokesman. “We hope to overcome the disputed issues soon,” he said.
Critics said that  Ghani is not willing to establish a council in which other leaders can partake in managing national issues after the withdrawal of foreign forces.
This comes a week after Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the High Council of National Reconciliation (HCNR), said the system will collapse if Afghan leaders do not forge a consensus on the issues of national importance.
“There are serious differences,” said Abdullah, referring to the differences between Afghan political leaders.
“There is a need to find systemic solutions for the questions that come from the public—so, ultimately, with the support of the people this ship (political system) is saved from a possible collapse,” said Abdullah.
Politicians believe that the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan, and also the political division between leaders, has emboldened the Taliban in its hopes to take power by military means.

‘Govt Controls Less Than Half of Territory in Balkh District’
","
At least 35% of the territory in Balkh district in the northern province of Balkh is under the government’s control while the remaining parts are either under Taliban influence or are contested between the two sides, an official said.
Balkh district has 184 villages, district governor Mohammad Yunus Stanekzai said, adding that 65 of them are under the government’s control.
The district has 180 members of public uprising forces who have a big role in ensuring the security of the district, Stanekzai said.
Balkh district is 24 kilometers far from Mazar-e-Sharif city, the center of Balkh, and is known as one of the most insecure districts in the province. The district has witnessed two big attacks in the last two months: one on an army base and another on police headquarters.
The district governor said that the public uprising forces need further support in terms of equipment.
“Balkh district has 184 districts. Unfortunately, most of the villages are under the opposition’s influence, but fortunately, we have a good percentage under our control where the morale is very high… At least 35% of the villages are under the government’s control.”
At least 20 members of public uprising forces are stationed at an outpost 4 kilometers far from Boka district, which is often contested between government forces and the Taliban. Security forces at the outpost said they are always ready to defend their areas against any threat from militants.
“Taliban attack whenever they find an opportunity, but we are fully ready to defend,” said Agha Mohammad, a commander of public uprising forces.
Another member of the public uprising forces said that clashes have intensified over the last few days.
“This area is called Piaaz-Kar. It is the frontline. The enemy roams here every night, but they have failed in their evil goal. They attack, but they are suppressed, they are defeated and then they go back,” said Hafizullah, a member of public uprising forces.
According to the local forces, the Taliban uses people’s homes for the war, a claim that was rejected by the group.
“These homes have been used in many attacks on us. They have shelled rockets on us from these homes, but they cannot succeed. We have given them a tit-for-tat response and we will do the same, going forward,” said Gulab Khan, a public uprising forces member.
The continuation of clashes in the district has created concerns among the resident who says violence must stop.
“The foreigners are leaving our country, but still attacks are happening in our district in which only civilians are harmed,” said Saifuddin, a Balkh resident.
“They destroyed houses, killed our people, and left them with a dark future, they planted mines. What is the sin of these Muslims? They are civilians,” said Abdul Jabbar, a Balkh resident.

Taliban: Turkey Should Withdraw Troops Under Doha Deal – Report
","
Amidst reports of Ankara’s proposal to guard and run Kabul’s airport after the withdrawal of US and coalition forces from the country, a Taliban spokesman has said that Turkey should pull its troops from Afghanistan under the Doha agreement, adding another layer of complexity to concerns about consequences of troop pullout.
Quoted by Reuters, Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen said that Turkey should withdraw its troops from Afghanistan under the Doha agreement.
In a text message to Reuters, Shaheen has said that Turkey should also leave Afghanistan as it has been a NATO member. 
“Turkey was part of NATO forces in the past 20 years, so as such, they should withdraw from Afghanistan on the basis of the Agreement we signed with US on 29th Feb 2020,” Shaheen said as quoted by Reuters.
“Otherwise, Turkey is a great Islamic country. Afghanistan has had historical relations with it. We hope to have close and good relations with them as a new Islamic government is established in the country in future,” he added as quoted by Reuters.
Reuters reports that the State Department and the Turkish Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The withdrawal of US and coalition forces from Afghanistan has left many with concerns about the country’s political future as well as the safety of other countries’ diplomats once all troops leave.

US Begins Combat Operations in Afghanistan from Abroad
","
US Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin on Thursday said the US military has already begun conducting combat operations and surveillance in Afghanistan from outside the country’s borders, but he did not mention whether the United States military will still conduct airstrikes in the country to defend population centers after the withdrawal completes.
“Going forward, in terms of our (counterterrorism) efforts, those CT efforts will be focused on those elements that can possibly conduct attacks against our homeland,” Austin said as quoted by the Air Force magazine.
Austin said the US military is already conducting air combat patrols and support from ships in the Gulf and sending surveillance aircraft to Afghanistan from nations in the Gulf region.
As of now, he said, the US is still looking for options to station troops and aircraft in neighboring countries to make the flight to Afghanistan shorter.
“We have the capability now to do that,” Austin said. “What we are looking for is the ability to shorten the legs going forward by stationing some capability in neighboring countries. That is still a work in progress.”
In response to a question on whether US aircraft would strike in support of Afghan forces to protect cities after the withdrawal, Austin said he would not speculate on “any potential outcomes or any potential future actions.”
“We continue to provide support to the Afghan security forces as we retrograde,” he said. “Once we have completed our retrograde, that will be very difficult to do because our capabilities will have diminished in country.”
The New York Times reported this week that the Pentagon is considering whether to intervene with warplanes or drones in the event that Kabul is in danger of falling to the Taliban, though no decisions have been made.
Quoting senior US officials, The Times reported that the Pentagon is considering seeking authorization to carry out airstrikes to support Afghan security forces if Kabul or another major city is in danger of falling to the Taliban.

Quadruplets, Triplets, Twins Born in Kabul in Past Week
","
Doctors at Malalai Hospital in Kabul say that in the past week, nineteen babies - quadruplets, triplets, and twins - have been born at the hospital, with most of the newborn babies and mothers in good health. 
Doctors at the hospital say, however, that the mothers of the quadruplets and triplets have come to Kabul from remote villages in several provinces where pregnancy care centers are rare.
The head of the hospital's neonatal department said that about 100 babies are born in the hospital every day, and some are affected by inadequate prenatal care.
Najiba Stanekzai, a doctor at Malalai Hospital in Kabul, said: “We have had some twins, triplets, quadruplets and even quintuplets in our hospital, these cases are 2-3 percent of all cases.”
Sharifa, a doctor at Malalai Hospital, said: “All the babies were in good condition, their weights were above 1.8 kilograms, which is normal.”
“It’s been three days since I came to the hospital, I went into surgery but now me and my babies, we are in good health,” said a mother who gave birth to twins.
Beheshta, also a mother of twins, said: “During my pregnancy, I ate meat, rice, and other healthy meals.”
Afghanistan still ranks among the countries with the highest maternal and infant mortality rates.
661 mothers die per 100,000 births in Afghanistan, according to the latest information provided by the Ministry of Public Health.

MPs Seek Deployment of Reinforcements to Frontlines in North
","
The centers of two districts in northern and northeastern Afghanistan have fallen to the Taliban, two lawmakers said on Friday, urging the Ministry of Defense to send reinforcements to the provinces to repel a possible collapse of some strategic areas to militants.
So far, sources and officials have confirmed that the centers of at least 17 districts have fallen to militants over the last two months. According to two MPs, the centers of Ishkamish district in Takhar and Sozma Qala district in Sar-e-Pul fell to the Taliban on Thursday.
The centers of Burka district in Baghlan, Narkh, and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak, Dawlat Shah district in Laghman, Qaisar district in Faryab, Shahrak district in Ghor, and Shirzad district in Uruzgan have fallen to the Taliban in less than two months.
The Taliban claims they have also captured Charkh district in Logar, Do Ab, and Mandol districts in Nuristan, Farsi district in Herat, Deh Yak district in Ghazni, Gezab district in Daikundi, and Shinkai district in Zabul.
“It was the Worsaj district, then Farkhar and Chah Ab, and ultimately, Ishkamish fell to militants and now the enemy is trying to divert its offensives on Bangi district,” said Amir Mohammad Khaksar, MP from Takhar.
“The (Qala-e-Naw) city is under the threat by Taliban. In Sozma Qala district, only district building and two check posts have remained, but according to our information, the center of the district has fallen (to militants),” said Sayed Hayatullah Alimi, MP from Sar-e-Pul.
A lawmaker from Badghis province in southwest Afghanistan said fighting between government forces and the Taliban has inched closer to the outskirts of Qala-e-Naw, the province's center. Badghis MPs also asked for additional troops deployed to the province to repel the threats.
Taliban also launched attacks on several fronts in Nimroz and Badakhshan provinces.
“We have lost several parts of Arghanjkhwah district in Badakhshan. The problem will get worse if the government does not take action regarding the issue,” said Hujjatullah Farahmand, MP from Badakhshan.
“The enemy launched a major offensive on Khashrod district in Nimroz to capture the district,” said Gul Ahmad Noorzad, an MP from Nimroz.

“Heavy casualties were inflected (to Taliban) in Pashtun Kot and Qaisar districts in Faryab, Sozma Qala district in Sar-e-Pul as well as in Uruzgan and Baghlan provinces,” the Defense Ministry spokesman Rohullah Ahmadzai said.
In a statement on Friday, the 209 Shaheen Army Corps assured the residents of Sar-e-Pul and Takhar that all districts in the two provinces will be protected against threats from militants.

Badakhshan Protesters Call for Governor's Dismissal
","
On the fourth day of protests in Badakhshan, demonstrators--who have set up a tent in the city of Faizabad--called for the dismissal of the current governor in the province. They reiterated their original demands for security, electricity, and water. 
The protesters said those who acted violently against demonstrators should be brought to justice.
According to the latest information provided by government officials, a protest on Tuesday in Faizabad, the capital of Badakhshan, turned violent with five protesters killed and over 41 wounded in a clash with security forces.
“We do not want money or something else, we want justice for our nation, for those who had the right to protest for their rights but were repressed by Zekria Sawda, the one who turned the protest violent and opened fire on protesters, he calls himself the killer of Badakhshan citizens,” said Mohammad Hashem, a protester in Faizabad city.
“Every day that passes, our protest is getting wider, today our demands are more than what they were in the previous days,” said Mohammad Khadem, a Faizabad protester.
The protesters warned they would continue to organize larger protests in the province If their demands were not met.
“Our first demand is that the killers of the people should be taken to court, our second demand is that power should be given to the Badakhshan people, third, we want to have water in our homes. We will continue our protest until these problems are solved,” said Taash Mohammad, a protester.
The Afghan government and the Afghan Parliament have assigned probe teams to investigate the incident which took place during the protest on Tuesday in Faizabad city and led to violence, leaving many protesters killed and wounded.
Golalai Akbari, one of the senators from Badakhshan province, said: “We hope the probe team that has gone to Badakshan will investigate the incident properly by considering both sides, the people and the government, and that the law will be enforced on either side. Anyone who disregarded the law and broke it and is guilty--justice should be met.”
The governor of Badakhshan said that the protest is against the government and that he would not step down without a presidential order.
“I have been appointed as Badakhshan's governor according to the Constitution and order of the President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, I would act accordingly and based on the decision and order that the president would offer,” said Zekria Sawda, the governor of Badakhshan.

NATO Allies, Including Turkey, Continue Talks on Kabul Airport
","
NATO is talking with different allies, including Turkey, on maintaining support to the international airport in Kabul after the US and coalition forces withdraw from the country, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Friday.
This development comes as a Taliban spokesman, quoted by Reuters, said Thursday that Turkey should pull its troops from Afghanistan under the Doha agreement, referring to Ankara’s proposal to guard and run Kabul’s airport after the withdrawal of US and coalition forces from the country.
But Stoltenberg said that NATO allies are working on how to maintain important infrastructure, such as an international airport in Kabul.
“Partly this is something NATO will support, and also we’re looking into how NATO Allies can be part of that effort. Turkey is today a key Ally when it comes to the running of the airport,” he said. “There is a dialogue now going on between different Allies, including Turkey, on exactly how we can try to continue to provide support for the airport and make sure the airport continues to operate at international standards.”
He said that this is important not only for NATO, but an airport and all the critical infrastructure is important for the whole international community, for the diplomatic presence of all countries, and for development aid and different aid organizations.
He said that he expects that the issue will be addressed at the Summit on Monday.
Stoltenberg reiterated that NATO’s military presence is ending, but its support for the Afghan forces and people will continue.
“We are very clear-eyed about the challenges, the difficulties we all face in Afghanistan. And we are also clear-eyed about the risks the decision to end our military mission entails,” he added.
He also mentioned that NATO will continue funding for Afghan Security Forces and that all allies are committed to continuing to do so.
US President Joe Biden announced in April that he will withdraw all American troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11. However, US officials have predicted that the withdrawal will be completed in July. US Central Command last week said that the withdrawal has been completed by more than 50%.

Blasts in Kabul Kill 7 Civilians: Ministry

Two blasts targeted two minivans carrying civilians in two areas in the west of Kabul on Saturday afternoon, the Ministry of Interior Affairs said.
One of the blasts happened in the Dasht-e-Barchi area in Kabul’s District 13 and another happened after less than 30 minutes in Mahtab Qala area in Kabul’s District 6.
The ministry said that seven people were killed in the two blasts and that the casualties may rise.
The blast in Dasht-e-Barchi killed one civilian and wounded four others, including a woman, the ministry said. 
Meanwhile, six civilians, including a woman, were killed and one more was wounded, the ministry added.
“A man walked out of the car and moved towards the hospital. There were two wounded and four martyrs in the car,” said Nasir, an eyewitness.
“They should stop 'genocide.' If they cannot prevent it, they should step down,” said a resident of Kabul Omid.
The Ministry of Inteiror said that only minutes after the first blast, the second blast occurred in Kabul's District 13.
“People are tired of these explosions. They cannot go to work and school,” said Salim, a resident of Kabul.
“Negligence is committed when it comes to the security of the west of Kabul,” said Ali Reza, a Kabul resident.
The blasts were similar to two explosions that happened in Kabul earlier this month, killing at least a dozen people, all civilians.
The Afghanistan Human Rights Commission, relying on its assessments about some recent terrorist attacks in Kabul, says that the Hazara community in Afghanistan are prone to “genocide,” reiterating that such targeted killings require comprehensive and deep investigation by an international team that should be picked by the UN. 
Since mid-May, at least five attacks have been conducted in Kabul in which majority of the victims were from the Hazara community, including the attack on Sayed al-Shuhada High School in west of Kabul that killed over 90 people, almost all of them students, two blasts that targeted city buses in west of Kabul on Tuesday and two explosions in the west of Kabul on Thursday that targeted a corolla vehicle and a minivan, killing nine civilians, all from the same community.

Legal Experts: Afghan MPs Not Above the Law
","
Legal experts on Saturday, referring to legal charges brought against members of Afghanistan’s Wolesi Jirga—the lower house of Parliament--said that no lawmaker is above the law.
Legal expert Wahidullah Farzaee argued that there is no difference between a lawmaker and an ordinary citizen when it comes to facing criminal charges and being accountable before the law of the nation.
“A person facing allegations--whether a member of the national assembly or an ordinary man--does not have legal immunity,” said legal expert Wahidullah Farzaee.
This comes a week after Mir Rahman Rahmani, the speaker of Afghanistan’s Parliament, during a parliamentary session said that there are allegations of bullying, kidnapping and corruption against some MPs, and stated that they have not yet appeared before the country’s legal and judicial institutions to respond to the allegations.
Reports said there are dozens of criminal and corruption cases involving members of Afghanistan’s Parliament and these members have not appeared in court.
“The Wolesi Jirga did not allow a legal and judicial investigation to be launched against those MPs who are accused of land grabbing, murder, and the kidnapping of debtors who owe for construction projects,” said MP Ramazan Bashardost.
“Dozens of letters sent by the legal and judicial institutions indicate that these people are accused of bullying and of being involved in kidnapping,” said Rahmani.
On Monday, Parliament speaker Rahmani said there are serious charges of bullying, kidnapping, keeping illegal armed men and money laundering against MP Shahpor Hassanzoi, and Hassanzoi has not appeared before the court to respond.
Hassanzoi rejected the allegations.
“If you really represent this Wolesi Jirga, then show me the second and third letters,” said Hassanzoi.
“A lawmaker is the servant of the public, not a boss who makes a show of his power; anyone who acts against the law must be referred to the legal and judicial institutions,” said MP Ziauddin Akazi.  
Ramani said another letter with allegations against MP Zia Yaftali was also sent to the Parliament from the legal and judicial bodies.
Meanwhile, the Office of the Attorney General of Afghanistan has said that it has launched an investigation into the reports of illegal activities involving some members of the Parliament.
Sources familiar with the process in the Afghan national assembly have said that there are several legal cases against the MPs in the legal organizations. A source said that the legal and judicial bodies are working on the case involving MP Zia Yaftali. The case against MP Hassanzoi, however, was being investigated by the criminal department of the Ministry of Interior.
“Cases that involve members of the national assembly and are sent to the Attorney General for investigation--the AGO has processed them in light of the law,” said Jamshid Rasuli, a spokesman to AGO.

Afghan Officials Make Plans for Post-Withdrawal Airport Security
","
An official from Afghanistan’s Civil Aviation Authority said work is underway on a security framework for Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul that will be finalized soon, but added that the government so far has not decided whether to hand over the responsibilities of the airport to Turkish forces once all foreign troops depart.
The security of the international airport after the full withdrawal of US and coalition forces has been a major concern for Afghanistan’s allies at NATO, which is expected to discuss the issue in a meeting this week with members of the alliance including Turkey. 
“Work on a framework is underway for all airports, including Kabul. It will be completed in the near future,” said Hasib Sorosh, the deputy head of the civil aviation authority for planning and policy.
The authority pledged that Afghanistan will have the ability to independently conduct airport operations after the withdrawal of troops.
“We can conduct aviation operations in all our international airports independently,” Sorosh said.
One member of the Taliban negotiating team in Doha told TOLOnews that the possibility of handing over the airport authority to Turkish forces will have a negative impact on the peace negotiations.
“This should have been sorted out when they were negotiating with the Taliban, but, unfortunately, they made haste at that time,” said Sayed Ishaq Gailani, the head of the National Solidarity Movement of Afghanistan.
The Taliban in a statement last week said the safety of the airport is part of the responsibility of Afghans, and called on all international troops, including Turkey’s forces, to leave Afghanistan under the Doha agreement signed in 2020.
“Afghanistan is ours and its protection is our enduring responsibility. Right now, Afghans are ready for this responsibility more than any other time,” said Rahmatullah Andar, spokesman for the National Security Council.
At a press conference on Friday, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance is talking with different allies, including Turkey, on maintaining support for the international airport in Kabul after the US and coalition forces withdraw from the country.
He said the issue is important not only for NATO: An airport and all the critical infrastructure is important for the whole international community, for the diplomatic presence of all countries, and for development aid and different aid organizations.

The two blasts in Kabul on Saturday afternoon killed seven people, all civilians, most of whom were from the Hazara community. Two similar blasts occurred earlier this month, killing nearly a dozen people, all from the same community.  
Khalili said that there is a lack of consensus among the country’s politicians over the peace process and this has delayed the formation of the Supreme State Council. He said the warring sides recently have directed their focus on war rather than peace. 
“No group can ever ensure peace in Afghanistan with force,” Khalili said. “Afghanistan’s solution is not war or force, or the continuation of a monopoly.”  
The Afghanistan Human Rights Commission, citing its assessments on some recent terrorist attacks in Kabul, said that the Hazara community in Afghanistan is vulnerable to “genocide,” reiterating that such targeted killings require comprehensive and deep investigations by an international team that should be picked by the UN.  
Since mid-May, at least five attacks were conducted in Kabul in which the majority of the victims were from the Hazara community: One included the attack on Sayed al-Shuhada High School in the west of Kabul that killed over 90 people, almost all of whom were students; two blasts targeted city buses in the west of Kabul on Tuesday; and two explosions in the west of Kabul on Thursday targeted a Corolla-model car and a minivan, killing nine civilians, all from the same community. 
“We seek cooperation from the National Security Council, the United Nations, our international allies as well as the government in this matter,” Khalili said, referring to recent attacks in the west of Kabul. 
Lawmakers from Kabul said the security forces are too few to provide safety for the residents in the capital.
“The government should not test the people’s patience. There is a possibility that our people will make attempts on their own to ensure their safety,” said Fatima Nazari, an MP from Kabul. 
Figures provided by some MPs show that at least 40 major targeted attacks have been carried out in the west of Kabul in the last two years.

Afghan Official Hopes Mecca Summit Will Yield Results for Peace
","
Ata-Ur-Rahman Saleem, the deputy head of the High Council for National Reconciliation who participated at the religious scholars’ joint conference in Mecca last week, said the summit was attended by a Pakistani cleric who oversees thousands of madrassas in that country where most Taliban leaders and commanders have studied.
He said the delegates at the summit declared Afghanistan’s war illegitimate, adding that the conference came about after a two-year effort by Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and other countries. He said he hopes the decision by the participants will positively influence the Taliban’s willingness to stop violence.
Saleem said that the most influential and biggest religious scholars from Pakistan, including Mawlawi Abdul Malik, Mawlawi Jan Andari, Mufti Taqi Osmani who is the deputy head of Pakistan’s Dar-ul-Olum, Mawlana Naeemi, Mawlana Qaderi, each of whom lead thousands of madrassas in Pakistan, called Afghanistan’s war haram--forbidden--and stressed the need for efforts toward peace in Afghanistan.
“Mawlana Jalal Andari spoke at the conference. He is the head of Pakistan’s madrassas. He leads over 3,000 of the best madrassas in Pakistan,” Saleem said.
Hosted by Saudi Arabia, the event brought together senior scholars from Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Arab News quoted the organizers of the conference as saying that the summit was conceived in order to utilize the MWL’s role in resolving conflicts within the Islamic world, with the support of Saudi Arabia. They said the work of the conference “will reflect the MWL’s sense of historic responsibility as a representative of all Muslims, and its desire to achieve unity, solidarity and harmony, the security of its societies, and the safety of its citizens.”
The opening session featured Mohammed bin Abdul Karim Al-Issa, secretary general of the MWL, Noor-ul-Haq Qadri, the Pakistani minister of religious affairs and interfaith harmony, and Mohammad Qasim Halimi, the Afghan minister of hajj and religious affairs.
They were joined by senior clerics from both countries.
Also in attendance was Lt. Gen. Bilal Akbar, the ambassador of Pakistan to Saudi Arabia, Ahmed Javed Mujadidi, the ambassador of Afghanistan to Saudi Arabia, Rizwan Saeed Sheikh, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and Shafiq Samim, Afghanistan’s permanent representative to the OIC.
“We tried in the past as well. We went there two years ago, and the clerics who talked yesterday were not ready to meet us in front of the media due to some reservations they had,” Saleem added.
He said that clear mechanisms are required to continue talks among religious scholars from Afghanistan and Pakistan.
“Afghanistan and Pakistani religious scholars attended the meeting. This is a good step and they declared the war forbidden,” said Mohammad Karim Khalili, former vice president.
An MP from Daikundi, Ali Akbar Jamshidi, meanwhile, said Pakistan’s government and army could also play a role in the success of such conferences.
“If Muslim world scholars issue a fatwa against the war and declare it forbidden, I am sure this will have a good impact on stopping the war and stopping recruitment,” he said.

2 Female Employees of Afghan Film Killed in Kabul Blast
","
Two young women who were killed in a blast on Saturday, Tayyiba Musawi and Fatima Mohammadi, were both employees at Afghan Film, an organization that produces films and promotes cinema in the country. Their bodies were recognized by their families a day after the deadly blast targeted their minivan in the west of Kabul.
Family members said they were searching for the bodies for four hours and finally found the two women at the morgue department in Kabul. The two were burned in the blast.
They had recently joined Afghan Film and were working on an animated film for children.
Tayyiba’s brother said she stayed awake at night to study and was waiting to start her master's degree. She also financially supported her family and was paying for her brother and sister's education expenses.
“I cannot describe the pain I felt. They were burned. We found them at the morgue after we searched the hospitals at night,” said Mahdi, Tayyiba’s brother.
“She worked hard and made a big effort to succeed. This government even cannot ensure the security of the capital,” said Sayed Ayub, Tayyiba’s uncle.
Tayyeba graduated from the fine arts department at Kabul University. She was an actress and played roles in various plays.
The two were returning home from the office when their vehicle was targeted by an explosion in the Dasht-e-Barchi area in the west of Kabul. They were laid to rest in Kabul on Sunday.
“The perpetrators should be hanged in the place where they conduct attacks. Then all things will be solved,” said Tayyiba’s uncle Mohammad Jawad Musawi.
Shafiqa, a Kabul resident, was wounded in Saturday’s blast in Dasht-e-Barchi. Her husband is a vendor and said he cannot afford to buy medicine for his wife.
Doctors said they have decided to amputate Shafiqa’s limbs because they sustained severe wounds.
“The patient also has trauma to the head. She also has burns… four of her fingers have also been cut off,” said Arif Haris, a doctor at Wazir Akbar Khan Hospital in Kabul. 
Seven people were killed in Saturday’s two blasts that happened within the same hour at two different locations in the west of Kabul.

MoI Arrests Mediators Helping Hand Over ANDSF Outposts to Taliban
","
Elders--or others--who act as mediators to negotiate between government forces and the Taliban-- causing security force members to abandon their posts--have been arrested, the Ministry of Interior Affairs (MoI) said on Sunday.  The ministry reiterated that cooperation with “terrorists” is unacceptable.
Many districts have recently fallen to the Taliban or have been evacuated after being under siege. Sources confirmed the fall of at least 20 distrits' centers to the Taliban in the last two months.
Over the last 24 hours, security forces evacuated Saghar district in Ghor, Arghandab district in Zabul and Posht Rod and Lash districts in Farah, bringing the total to 23.
Security agencies said that government forces have either shifted the centers of the districts or they have made tactical retreats. The Taliban has claimed to have captured these districts.
“There were clashes in Posht Rod district last night during which the police headquarters fell to militants,” said Dadullah Qane, head of the Farah provincial council.
“We lost our security forces and youth, and the wounded are in critical condition,” said Anisa Ghayur, a member of Ghor's provincial council.
The Taliban claimed on Sunday to have captured the center of Arghandab district in Zabul and two markets in Ali Abad district in Kunduz.
However, security forces said the Khashrod district in Nimroz was retaken hours after it fell to the Taliban.
“Security outposts were attacked by the enemy in Khan Abad and Ali Abad districts. So far, the security and defense forces have responded strongly,” said Inamuddin Rahmani, spokesman for the Kunduz police.
The Ministry of Interior Affairs said that security forces have been directed to arrest those who attempt to mediate between government forces and the Taliban to hand over security forces outposts. 
“The reason that soldiers leave their outposts is that they are faced with the lack of facilities, equipment and personnel,” said Shogufa Nawrozi, an MP from Helmand.
Clashes have been reported in at least 20 provinces over 70 districts, according to sources and officials.
Footage obtained by TOLOnews shows some soldiers in Lash wa Joyan district in Farah province, apparently pleading for help.
The Ministry of Defense responded by pledging that the security forces will receive support when they need it.
“The enemy has suffered its highest casualties in Nimroz, Badghis and Helmand provinces,” Defense Ministry spokesman Rohullah Ahmadzai said.
Local security officials in Ghazni and Takhar on Sunday said security forces had progressed in the two provinces and that the Taliban suffered “heavy casualties” during their operations.

Residents in Western Kabul Demand Security, Answers
","
Residents of western Kabul demanded answers for the recent attacks on civilians, saying the government, especially security agencies, has not applied an effective plan to prevent such incidents and boost the safety of the area. 
Figures collected by TOLOnews show that 25 people were killed and 27 were wounded in six blasts that targeted passenger minivans and other vehicles in the west of Kabul in the past two weeks. 
Sayed Murtaza, a civil society activist, 45, was killed in Saturday’s blast in the west of Kabul that targeted a minivan. He was the only breadwinner for his seven-member family. 
“Our safety should be ensured. We don’t have further patience to lose our loved ones,” said Sajida, Murtaza’s daughter. 
“What is our sin? To whom should we take our complaints? I am not telling the government or the international community, I am calling on the Taliban--why are you killing me?” said Sayed Ali, Murtaza’s son. 
Following last month’s deadly blasts near Sayed al-Shuhada school in the west of Kabul that killed at least 90 people, President Ashraf Ghani ordered his team to make a security plan for the west of Kabul. But it is not clear when it will be implemented.
“They are attacking minivans and buses in the west of Kabul. I have lost three members of my family,” said Haji Qasim, a resident of the west of Kabul.
“We have demands for the government, for the president, who should make efforts to help us,” said Mohammad Zia, another resident of the area.
President Ghani’s senior adviser Mohammad Mohaqiq also criticized the government for not showing an interest in implementing a security plan for the west of Kabul.
“It should not be included in long-term or time-consuming plans. It needs urgency because the people are faced with an unmerciful enemy,” Mohaqiq told TOLOnews.
“Work is underway on the plan in terms of technical aspects and security. We are working to fill the gaps to boost security in those areas,” said Tariq Arian, spokesman for the Ministry of Interior Affairs.
TOLOnews figures show that over the last two weeks, two buses and four minivans have been targeted by blasts in various areas in western Kabul.

Erdogan Says US Can Rely on Turkey Once Troops Leave Afghanistan
","
Amidst talks on handing over responsibilities of the security of Kabul airport to Turkish forces, Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday said his country would be the ""only reliable"" country left to stabilize Afghanistan after the US pulls out its troops, indicating Washington could rely on its NATO ally. 
Quoted by AFP, Erdogan said he will discuss the issue in his first face-to-face meeting with US President Joe Biden on the margins of a NATO summit in Brussels on Monday.
""America is preparing to leave Afghanistan soon and from the moment they leave, the only reliable country to maintain the process over there is obviously Turkey,"" Erdogan told reporters at an Istanbul airport on Sunday before leaving for Brussels as quoted by AFP.
The withdrawal of US forces as been completed by greater than 50 percent, the US Central Command said last week.
Turkey has reportedly said it is prepared to keep troops in Afghanistan to protect Kabul airport, the main exit route for western diplomats and humanitarian workers. 
According to AFP, Erdogan said on Sunday that Turkish officials had informed their American counterparts about Ankara's plans in Afghanistan after the US troop pullout, without providing details. 
They are ""pleased and happy. We will be able to discuss the Afghanistan process with them,"" he said. 
An official from Afghanistan’s Civil Aviation Authority said work is underway on a security framework for Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul that will be finalized soon, but added that the government so far has not decided whether to hand over the responsibilities of the airport to Turkish forces once all foreign troops depart.
The security of the international airport after the full withdrawal of US and coalition forces has been a major concern for Afghanistan’s allies at NATO, which is expected to discuss the issue in a meeting this week with members of the alliance including Turkey. 
The authority pledged that Afghanistan will have the ability to independently conduct airport operations after the withdrawal of troops.
A member of the Taliban negotiating team in Doha told TOLOnews that the possibility of handing over the airport authority to Turkish forces will have a negative impact on the peace negotiations.
The Taliban in a statement last week said the safety of the airport is part of the responsibility of Afghans, and called on all international troops, including Turkey’s forces, to leave Afghanistan under the Doha agreement signed in 2020.
At a press conference on Friday, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance is talking with different allies, including Turkey, on maintaining support for the international airport in Kabul after the US and coalition forces withdraw from the country.
He said the issue is important not only for NATO: An airport and all the critical infrastructure is important for the whole international community, for the diplomatic presence of all countries, and for development aid and different aid organizations.

US to 'Keep Pressure' on Daesh, Al Qaeda in Afghanistan: McKenzie
","
The head of US Central Command, Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie, said on Sunday that the US will seek to ""keep pressure"" on Daesh and Al Qaida, the Military Times reported.
“One thing I probably need to emphasize is we will still do everything we can to keep pressure on Daesh and Al Qaeda, from our over-the-horizon locations,” McKenzie said in an interview with Military Times.
“That is a task I’ve been given. Those are plans I’m in discussion with now with the secretary of defense. How we will do that, I’ve said before, that will be a very difficult thing to do,” he said.
In response to a question about the recent UN report warning that the Taliban appeared poised to take back control of Afghanistan, McKenzie said: “We still intend to support the Afghan military from just over the horizon. We’re still going to support them with funding.”
“We’re going to try very hard to support the Afghan air force over the horizon; some things will come out of the country to be worked on,” he said. “I don’t want to minimize this, because I think they’re going to be tested, but we will continue to support them, just not in the way we are supporting them now.”
He said: “The fighting is seesaw right now. You know we will do everything we can to help the Afghans going forward within the limits that we have, which is, of course, no boots on the ground. But it’s gonna be really on their shoulders now to stand or fall, and I think they have a fighting chance to do it. That’s what I’ve said before, and we’ll do everything we can to help them.”
Asked if the US would provide any combat support to Afghan forces if major cities such as Kabul were at risk of being overrun, he said: “Those are actually, as you will appreciate, policy decisions, not military decisions. I will tell you this. Right now what we’re planning to do after we withdraw is keep pressure on Al Qaida and Daesh, and that would be what we’d be doing, going back into Afghanistan.”
“When those entities presented actionable threats against the United States, we’d be prepared to go in there and take action if our Afghan partners are unable to do that, and that will be the limit of our kinetic actions in Afghanistan,” he said.
Asked about China and Russia stepping up efforts in Afghanistan, McKenzie said: “The Chinese, I think they would like to get in for the mass mineral deposits that exist on the ground in Afghanistan and in other places, and that’s their interest.”
“I think the Russians have concerns about the spread of terror north through the Stans into Russia. I think both are interested in it. None of them have been particularly supportive of us while we’ve been there, and if we leave, I think they will try to move in to fill what they perceive to be a vacuum,” he said.
“They may find that to be harder than they think, though, to actually accomplish,” he added.
In April US President Joe Biden announced that US troops will leave Afghanistan by September 11.

“NATO is planning to provide support and also some NATO allies are now in direct dialogue, including the United States and Turkey and others, on how to make sure that we can maintain an international airport in Kabul,” he said. 
“This is of course important for NATO allies, but it's also important for the whole international community for diplomatic presence, and also for continued development aid,” Stoltenberg said.

 “We will do that partly through our civilian presence, where we will provide support, advice, to the Afghan security institutions.

ANDSF Retakes 2 Districts as Fighting Intensifies
","
Amid a sharp rise in fighting, Afghan forces have retaken two districts in the north in the last five days. However, other districts continue to fall to the Taliban.
Khan Abad district in Kunduz was retaken on Monday and Chah Ab district in Takhar was retaken last week.
Meanwhile, security forces reported that they evacuated the center of Sayyad district in the northern province of Sar-e-Pul and Oba district in the western province of Herat.
Figures collected by TOLOnews reveal that centers of at least 30 districts have fallen to the Taliban in less than two months.
“Over 50 militants were killed in face-to-face fighting and by airstrikes in Khan Abad. Some commanders are also among them,” said Kunduz Police Chief Farid Mashal.
Oba district in Herat; Shahrak, Tolak and Saghar districts in Ghor; Posht and Lash o Joyan districts in Farah; Jawand and Murghab districts in Badghis; Dawlat Abad district and Qaisar districts in Faryab; Sayyad and Sozma Qala districts in Sar-e-Pul; Burka district in Baghlan; Ishkamish district in Takhar; and Zari district in Balkh are among the 30 districts that have fallen to militants during this period, according to TOLOnews findings.
“The root causes of why districts started to fall suddenly should be determined. Some districts were handed over to the Taliban in the west without resistance and their equipment was left for militants,” said Sadiq Qaderi, an MP from Herat.
Centers of the following districts are among those captured by the Taliban: Washir district in Helmand; Arghistan district in Kandahar; Shinkai and Arghandab districts in Zabul; Chinarto and Gezab districts in Uruzgan; Dob and Mandol districts in Nuristan; Arghanjkhwah district in Badakhshan; Deh Yak, Jaghato, Rashidan and Ab Band districts in Ghazni; Charkh district in Logar; Narkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak; and Dawlat Shah districts in Laghman.
“Districts are falling every day. Nothing changes then. They announce they have retreated. What does this mean? Kabul will fall and they will say that they have retreated,” said Rohullah, a Kabul resident.
“People are worried. Kabul might fall if the collapse of districts continues,” said Hashemi, a Kabul resident.
First Vice President Amrullah Saleh said that the recent advancements by the Taliban are narrow and that this narrow line of the Taliban “will soon be changed into a graveyard” for the group.
“In many areas that have been called a 'collapse,' Talib, by creating a narrow line, has progressed. Their sequence has no depth or width. Those who are familiar with the fight against Talib know that this narrow line will turn into a mass grave for this group of horror and ignorance,” Saleh said in a Facebook post. 
“There are areas in districts where we made retreats. New forces were sent, they were equipped and the enemy will soon be removed from there,” Defense Ministry spokesman Rohullah Ahmadzai said. 
“Tactical and operational initiatives are rare. They should bring in new methods. Districts should be helped by their neighboring districts if they are attacked,” said former deputy minister of interior, Mirza Mohammad Yarmand.
At least 40 security force members have been either killed or wounded in clashes over the past 24 hours, but the Defense Ministry said Taliban casualties are higher than those of the government forces. 
The Taliban has rejected figures provided by the ministry.

MPs Call for Better Support of ANDSF As Fighting Continues
","
A group of lawmakers on Sunday accused the president and security agencies of not paying sufficient attention to equipping and supporting soldiers on the frontlines, saying that the fall of some districts in recent weeks is alarming.
The lawmakers questioned the government for appointing an acting minister for the Ministry of Interior Affairs and said Afghanistan has many talented figures who can better run the ministry. They called on the president to appoint a new pick for the ministry as soon as possible.
“We ask the government’s political leaders and the leaders of the security agencies to involve the people in independent self-defense through an inclusive national and political mobilization and to review existing policies,” Wolesi Jirga Speaker Mir Rahman Rahmani said.
“I am sure that provinces will fall if the situation continues. The Defense Ministry is fully paralyzed. It is not responsive. The defense minister is ill. I don’t think there is lack of elites (for the post),” said Nilofar Jalali Kofi, an MP from Kunduz.
“Mr. President, what will be your response be on doom's day? The casualties are due to the inefficiency of the leaders,” said Shahpoor Hasanzoi, an MP from Logar.
Other groups of MPs said that another reason behind the current crisis in the country is an ethnic and favoritism-oriented treatment toward appointments in security agencies by the president.
“The brother who runs the Ministry of Interior was distributing dates to drivers during Ramadan. Why is this brother not distributing water to soldiers on the frontlines?” asked Abdul Zahir Tamim, an MP from Badghis, referring to Hayatullah Hayat, the acting minister of interior.
“You are appointing your own picks at a ministry as a symbolic role. The Ministry of Interior is on the verge of collapse,” said Fatima Kohistani, an MP from Ghor.
“Officials are not responsive. The situation will worsen if this continues,” said Zia-ud-Din, an MP from Ghor.
The lawmakers praised security forces for their bravery but said that history will judge inefficient officials harshly.
“It is treason, and a crime against the rights of these people as they are killed. If it is expected to hand over provinces, why should it involve bloodshed?” said Belqis Roshan, an MP from Farah.
“We don’t have a minister in this violent situation, the army chief has gone on a trip and the interior minister is unprofessional,” said Gul Ahmad Noorzad, an MP from Nimroz.
Bu the government said efforts are underway to manage the crisis. President Ghani in a meeting with security officials on Sunday ordered proper plans against threats and movements by terrorists, according to a statement by the Presidential Palace.

Three blasts occurred near the school on the afternoon of May 8, killing at least 90 students and wounding over 150 others. The parents of the survivors said the government has encouraged them to send back their children to school.

NATO Leaders Agree to Maintain Funding for Kabul Airport
","
NATO leaders at the Brussels summit on Monday agreed to maintain funding for the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul after the Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan ends.
Addressing a press conference after the summit, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the RS mission is ending but NATO will continue supporting Afghanistan in four ways: funding Afghan forces, out-of-country training for Afghan forces, a continued civilian presence, and maintaining ""critical infrastructure"" such as the Kabul airport.
“NATO and allies are now working on how to ensure the continued operation of an international airport in Kabul. There were meetings also on the sidelines of the summit today. Turkey of course plays a key role in those efforts. We are working on exactly how to do it but there is a strong commitment from NATO and from NATO allies to ensure that we can operate an international airport,” he said.
NATO leaders in a statement issued from the Brussels summit affirmed their commitment to continue to stand with Afghanistan, its people, and its institutions in promoting security and upholding the hard-won gains of the last 20 years.
“Recalling our previous commitments, NATO will continue to provide training and financial support to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, including through the Afghan National Army Trust Fund,” the statement said.
It added that NATO will retain a Senior Civilian Representative’s Office in Kabul to continue diplomatic engagement and enhance its partnership with Afghanistan.
""Recognizing its importance to an enduring diplomatic and international presence, as well as to Afghanistan's connectivity with the world, NATO will provide transitional funding to ensure continued functioning of Hamid Karzai International Airport,"" said the statement. 
“We will also step up dialogue on Afghanistan with relevant international and regional partners,” the statement said. “We continue to support the ongoing Afghan-owned and Afghan-led peace process, and call on all stakeholders to help Afghanistan foster a lasting inclusive political settlement that puts an end to violence; safeguards the human rights of Afghans, particularly women, children, and minorities; upholds the rule of law; and ensures that Afghanistan never again serves as a safe haven for terrorists.”

US President Joe Biden at a press conference after the NATO leaders’ summit in Brussels on Monday “there was a strong consensus in the room, among the leaders, in that meeting, on Afghanistan,” reiterating that the alliance will continue its support to Afghans after the withdrawal of international troops from the country. 
“Our troops are coming home, but we agreed that our diplomatic, economic, and humanitarian commitment to the Afghan people and our support for the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces will endure,” Biden said. 
“And I welcomed our Allies and partners to recognize that counterterrorism — that counterterrorism efforts must continue to ensure that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for attacks on our countries,” he said. 
On Monday, the NATO leaders at the Brussels summit agreed to maintain funding for the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul after the Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan ends. 
Addressing a press conference after the summit, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the RS mission is ending but NATO will continue supporting Afghanistan in four ways: funding Afghan forces, out-of-country training for Afghan forces, a continued civilian presence, and maintaining ""critical infrastructure"" such as the Kabul airport. 
“NATO and allies are now working on how to ensure the continued operation of an international airport in Kabul. There were meetings also on the sidelines of the summit today. Turkey of course plays a key role in those efforts. We are working on exactly how to do it but there is a strong commitment from NATO and from NATO allies to ensure that we can operate an international airport,” he said. 
NATO leaders in a statement issued from the Brussels summit affirmed their commitment to continue to stand with Afghanistan, its people, and its institutions in promoting security and upholding the hard-won gains of the last 20 years. 
“Recalling our previous commitments, NATO will continue to provide training and financial support to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, including through the Afghan National Army Trust Fund,” the statement said. 
It added that NATO will retain a Senior Civilian Representative’s Office in Kabul to continue diplomatic engagement and enhance its partnership with Afghanistan. 
""Recognizing its importance to an enduring diplomatic and international presence, as well as to Afghanistan's connectivity with the world, NATO will provide transitional funding to ensure continued functioning of Hamid Karzai International Airport,"" said the statement. 
“We will also step up dialogue on Afghanistan with relevant international and regional partners,” the statement said. “We continue to support the ongoing Afghan-owned and Afghan-led peace process, and call on all stakeholders to help Afghanistan foster a lasting inclusive political settlement that puts an end to violence; safeguards the human rights of Afghans, particularly women, children, and minorities; upholds the rule of law; and ensures that Afghanistan never again serves as a safe haven for terrorists.”

5 Polio Vaccination Campaign Workers Killed in Nangarhar
","
Five workers in a polio vaccination campaign were killed and four more were wounded in five separate attacks in Nangarhar province on Tuesday morning, said Ataullah Khogyani, spokesman for the provincial governor. 
The attacks were perpetrated by unknown armed men in Sorkh Rod and Khogyani districts and the city of Jalalabad, Khogyani said. 
He said that two of the wounded are in critical condition.  
Khogyani said that special security measures were not provided to the campaign workers even though security agencies have been asked to cooperate with health workers.  
So far, no group has claimed responsibility for the attacks. 
This comes as three women working for the polio vaccination campaign were killed in two separate attacks in the city of Jalalabad in Nangarhar province on March 30.
Figures by UNICEF show that 56 new cases of poliovirus were reported in Afghanistan in 2020. 
The campaign is expected to cover 9.6 million children under five years of age in the country.

UN Plans for Increase of Displaced Afghans After Troop Pullout
","
The United Nations is preparing for a likely further displacement of civilians in Afghanistan after US and international troops leave the country in September, UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi said on Monday as quoted by Reuters.
Violence has remained high in the country over the last two months, leading to the displacement of thousands of families in northern and southern Afghanistan. 
He cited an attack on deminers last week in Baghlan province. 
“This is a tragic indicator of the type of violence that may be resurfacing in Afghanistan, and with the withdrawal of the international troops this is possibly or likely going to become worse,” he said as quoted by Reuters. 
“Therefore,” he said, “we are doing contingency planning inside the country for further displacement in the neighboring countries in case people might cross borders.” 
According to UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR), there are currently some 2.5 million registered refugees from Afghanistan globally, while another 4.8 million have been displaced within the country. 
Grandi said strong international support was needed for peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban. 
“It's political action that should substitute conflict but, of course, the risk (of further displacement) is there and we need to be prepared,” he added as quoted by Reuters. 
Earlier this month the United States announced more than $266 million in new humanitarian aid for Afghanistan, bringing to nearly $3.9 billion the total amount of such aid it has provided since 2002.

Experts Criticize Govt’s War Management, Military Strategy
","
Military analysts and former security officials strongly criticized the government’s current management of the war against the Taliban, saying the reason behind the collapse of districts to the Taliban is that the government’s military leaders have failed to lead the war in a successful way.
Wais Ahmad Barmak, the former Afghan Minister of Interior, said that the politicization of the war by political leaders and the rapid appointments of new military leaders has had a negative impact on the morale of the security forces.
However, the Office of National Security Council said that there is coordination between the security agencies, and the government's handling of the war has improved.
Fighting has significantly increased in Afghanistan in the past two months.
Military analysts said that while the country needs strong military leadership, the Ministry of Interior is being run by a caretaker and the minister of defense has again traveled abroad.
They also criticized the recent reshuffling in the National Directorate of Security.
“One of the fundamental issues that we are dealing with in the current situation is the lack of preemptive planning,” said former minister of interior Wais Ahmad Barmak.
“There are several decision-making centers (including) the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces ... the National Security Council has changed from a consultative body to an executive body,” said military analyst Zahir Azimi.
“At the 6:30 meeting the Ministry of Defense had its own internal disagreement, while in the Ministry of Interior there is an unprofessional man,” said military analyst Zahir Azimi.
“From the military power perspective, the security forces are not vulnerable to any terrorist group,” said Rohullah Ahmadzai, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.
“The appointments in the ministries are coming from the National Security Council and this incompetence has led to the current situation that we have in Afghanistan,” said Mohammad Nasim Mudabir, a member of Parliament’s internal security commission.
“Our colleagues at the National Security Council and their leadership should provide answers to the nation about why several appointments occurred and why the reshuffling took place in the NDS in less than two or three weeks,” said Wais Ahmad Barmak, the former interior minister.
“The war management has improved more than ever; there is extended coordination among our forces,” said Rahmatullah Andar, a spokesman for the Office of the National Security Council.
The Taliban significantly increased their attacks on the Afghan forces following the announcement of the unconditional withdrawal of US and NATO forces from Afghanistan.
According to the Parliament’s commission on internal security, currently fighting is ongoing in 300 points across Afghanistan.

Families of Slain Women Say Attacks on Civilians 'Systematic'
","
The family members of Zainab Musavi and Suhaila, the two young women who killed in a blast on Saturday, said on Tuesday that the recent attacks on civilians--particularly on the young and educated--are being carried out in a deliberate way.
They criticized the government for not identifying those responsible for the crimes.
Both victims started school together as little girls, became friends as adolescents and completed their university studies together as well. Zainab was 26 and Suhaila was 25.
“They were friends for twelve years, they were very close to each other, we had family relations,” said Fatima, the mother of Suhaila.
“How long will this bloodshed continue? May God bless us with peace,” said Hussnia, the mother of Zaiban.
“No one is there to hear our voice, no one is there to come and respond to us, why should they (civilians) be killed?"" said Ghulam Reza, father of Suhaila.
“Everyday explosions target cars, minivans and busses, why are our educated youths being killed?” said Assadullah Musavi, father of Zainab.
Zainab was expected to travel to Japan for her master's degree in the near future.
In recent weeks, at least 10 attacks have targeted civilians in the western part of Kabul.
Two explosions hit civilian cars in Kabul on Saturday killing at least 6 people and wounding 7 more.
No group or individual has claimed responsibility for the attack.

Citing Makkah Statement, Protestors Urge Taliban to Stop Fighting
","
In a press conference held in Kabul on Tuesday, Afghan civil society activists announced their support for the statement by religious scholars at the Makkah summit that declared the Afghan war illegitimate.
The religious scholars' ‘Makkah Summit’ was held in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, on Thursday and included clerics from Pakistan and Afghanistan.
The summit issued and released a Fatwa (a ruling on a point of Islamic law) declaring the ongoing war in Afghanistan illegitimate.
Civil activists, citing the fatwa, called on the Taliban to stop the killing of Afghans and to put an end to the war that takes lives every day on both sides, adding that it is time for the Taliban to select the path of peace.
“I am ready to meet with you, Taliban, but you do not have the courage to fight me face to face, do you? You are stabbing us from behind, what kind of war is this? We are really sick of it,"" said Samiyeh Qaderi, a female civil society activist in Kabul.
won’t go back! To where should we go back? The same 'back' where we were hanged at the crossroads. The very 'back' where we could not study,” she said.
In a statement, the civil society activists called on the United Nations and international human rights organizations to investigate the ""crimes committed by the Taliban against the people of Afghanistan"" and to put pressure on the Taliban by imposing sanctions on them.
“The Taliban not only haven't stopped their fighting but have continued their terrorist and suicide attacks against the innocent and Muslim people of Afghanistan,” said Ehsanullah Qaderi, a civil society activist, who added: ""The actions of the Taliban shows that they are not respecting any religious, Islamic or human values.”
The civil society activists affirmed that a continuation of the war in the country cannot be a solution to the crisis in Afghanistan.
“We call on the Taliban not to massacre our nation's people under the pretext of defending Islam. Do not destroy our homeland, the war in Afghanistan has no religious legitimacy. The nation and the security forces are all Muslim,” said Rahimullah Naseeri, head of the Hamnawa Youth Foundation.
The Taliban previously denied allegations of war crimes, saying the group's enemies are giving false information to human rights advocacy groups.

“We appeal to the government to focus on the Sar-e-Pul province,” said Mohammad Taqi, a resident in Sar-e-Pul.
The Taliban took over Kohistanat district in Sar-e-Pul province a few years ago.

In addition, there are reports that several checkpoints have fallen to the Taliban in the Sayedabad district of Maidan Wardak province.
Meanwhile, the Afghan Ministry of Defense said that the security forces will change the current security situation.

Abdullah: Taliban is Emboldened by US Pullout But Cannot Win
","
Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the High Council for National Reconciliation (HCNR), on Wednesday said that the US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan paved the way for the Taliban to increase the level of violence.
Abdullah said that the Taliban is expanding the war and seeks to be the winner on the battlefield but it will not be able to dominate Afghanistan militarily.
The comments came at an event in Kabul organized by the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) and UN Women titled “Gender-Responsive Ceasefires.” 
“The Taliban used the opportunity (troop withdrawal) and tried to be the winner on the battlefield, and their day-and-night activity indicates this reality,” said Abdullah.
“It is impossible for the Taliban to take over Afghanistan through war,” cautioned Abdullah.
Meanwhile, the UN also called on the Afghan warring sides not to lose the current opportunity for peace.
Abdullah said the Taliban will be responsible for a ""major historic loss"" if they insist on fighting and reject the current opportunity for peace.
“The Afghans have been pushing for a ceasefire since the start of the talks, the entire international community and the UN secretary general have called for a ceasefire,” Abdullah said.
Abdullah also praised the sacrifices of the Afghan National Security and Defense Forces (ANDSF).
“We support these forces (ANDSF) who are the guardians of peace in the future and we should encourage their morale, we should avoid making them worry unnecessarily,” said Abdullah.
“Ceasefire and ending hostilities are the fundamental demand of the people, expansion of violence shouldn’t obstruct efforts for peace,” said Shahrzad Akbar, the head of AIHRC.
Mette Knudsen, deputy special representative (Political) for Afghanistan in the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA):
“Afghanistan has experienced a short period of respite during Eid ceasefires that have been put in place both by the Taliban and the government this year and the years past. These have been positive steps and gave some hope to people and a limited sense of safety, but they are definitely not enough and the violence remains unacceptably high,” she said.

Afghan women are worried about their future following a dramatic surge in the level of targeted attacks on women in recent months, said UNAMA.

23 Commandos Killed Attempting to Hold Dawlat Abad Center: Source
","
At least 23 members of an Afghan Army’s special forces unit were killed while fighting the Taliban in the northern province of Faryab on Wednesday, a security official who wished not to be named said on Thursday.  
The clash started in Dawlat Abad district after commandos and local troops launched a clearing operation, according to the source.   
“At least 23 commandos were killed and six policemen were wounded in the clashes,” the source said.   
The security forces retreated from the center of the district after heavy clashes and are stationed in Qaramqol district in Faryab following the clashes, the source said.  
One of those killed, Sohrab Azimi, 27, was a special forces officer who had received military training in the US as well as in Turkey. He was the son of retired Gen. Zahir Azimi, a former spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.  
In a social media post, Azimi confirmed his son’s death in the fighting and said he is “proud of his martyrdom.”  
Azimi said that his son and his son's colleagues did their duty proudly and courageously and sacrificed their lives to defend the country.  
He also blamed officials for not providing support during the operation.  
“His blood is not more than the other sons of this nation. I am proud that he performed the duty given to him until the end. He took the district and raised Afghanistan’s flag, and to keep it he fought until he died,” Zahir Azimi said. 
“It was expected that reinforcements would be sent to the area for their support, but unfortunately it didn't happen,” he said. “The clashes escalated and they were surrounded at the place where he was killed with some of his friends and others who were injured--they were shot and killed by the Taliban.” 
Sohrab worked in the support section of the special forces, but when the district fell to the Taliban he took charge of a group of 35 commandos to fight the Taliban in the district on Tuesday morning, local sources and security sources said. 
“They were pushing back the Taliban from the center of the district but the Taliban was attacking the security forces and security force members were killed,” according to sources. 
“The commandos sent their vehicles outside the area to bring army soldiers, and in the meantime, the Taliban attacked the commandos,” the sources added. 
The center of Dawlat Abad district has fell to the Taliban a week ago following heavy clashes.  
Violence remains high in the country amid a stalled peace process. Official sources on Wednesday reported fighting between Afghan security forces and the Taliban in at least 80 districts over the course of a day.  
According to the sources, over 100 Taliban fighters and 90 security force members were killed during this period. Neither the Taliban nor the government has provided numbers of casualties.

Biden and Putin Agree to Steps on Cybersecurity, Arms Control
","
US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on Wednesday to begin cybersecurity and arms control talks at a summit that highlighted their discord on those issues, human rights and Ukraine. 
In their first meeting since he took office in January, Biden asked Putin how he would feel if a ransomware attack hit Russia's oil network, a pointed question making reference to the May shutdown of a pipeline that caused disruptions and panic-buying along the US East Coast. 
While Biden stressed that he did not make threats during the three-hour meeting, he said he outlined US interests, including cybersecurity, and made clear to Putin that the United States would respond if Russia infringed on those concerns. 
Both men used careful pleasantries to describe their talks in a lakeside Swiss villa, with Putin calling them constructive and without hostility and Biden saying there was no substitute for face-to-face discussions. 
They also agreed to send their ambassadors back to each other's capitals. Russia recalled its envoy after Biden said in March that he thought Putin was a ""killer."" The United States recalled its ambassador soon after. 
Putin said on Wednesday that he had been satisfied by Biden’s explanation of the remark. 
But there was no hiding their differences on issues such as human rights, where Biden said the consequences for Russia would be ""devastating"" if jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny died, or cyberspace, where Washington has demanded Moscow crack down on ransomware attacks emanating from Russian soil. 
""I looked at him and said: 'How would you feel if ransomware took on the pipelines from your oil fields?' He said: 'It would matter,'"" Biden told reporters at an unusual solo news conference, itself an illustration of the tensions between the two nations. 
The query referred to a cyberattack that closed the Colonial Pipeline Co system for several days in May, preventing millions of barrels of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from flowing to the East Coast from the Gulf Coast. 
Biden also vowed to take action against any Russian cyberattacks: ""I pointed out to him that we have significant cyber capability. And he knows it."" 
'THIS IS NOT ABOUT TRUST' 
Speaking to reporters before Biden, Putin dismissed US concerns about Navalny, Russia's increased military presence near Ukraine's eastern border and US suggestions that Russians were responsible for the cyberattacks on the United States. 
He also suggested Washington was in no position to lecture Moscow on rights, batting away question about his crackdown on political rivals by saying he was trying to avoid the ""disorder"" of a popular movement, such as Black Lives Matter. 
""What we saw was disorder, disruption, violations of the law, etc. We feel sympathy for the United States of America, but we don’t want that to happen on our territory and we'll do our utmost in order to not allow it to happen,” he said. 
He also seemed to question the legitimacy of arresting the rioters who attacked the US Capitol on Jan. 6, seeking to stop Biden’s certification as president after he beat his predecessor, Donald Trump, in the November election by over 7 million votes. 
Biden said any comparison between what happened on Jan. 6 and the Black Lives Matter movement was “ridiculous.” 
US-Russia relations have been deteriorating for years, notably with Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, its 2015 intervention in Syria and US charges - denied by Moscow - of meddling in the 2016 election won by Trump. 
Neither side gave details on how their planned cybersecurity talks might unfold, although Biden said he told Putin that critical infrastructure should be “off-limits” to cyberattacks, saying that included 16 sectors that he did not publicly identify. 
""We need some basic rules of the road that we can all abide by,"" Biden said he had told Putin. 
Biden said he raised human rights issues because it was in the ""DNA"" of his country to do so, and also because of the fate of US citizens jailed in Russia. 
Putin said he believed some compromises could be found, although he gave no indication of any prisoner exchange deal. 
Putin, 68, called Biden, 78, a constructive, experienced partner, and said they spoke ""the same language."" But he added that there had been no friendship, rather a pragmatic dialogue about their two countries' interests. 
""President Biden has miscalculated who he is dealing with,"" said US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who is close to Trump. He called it ""disturbing"" to hear Biden suggest that Putin cared about his standing in the world. 
Trump was accused by both Democrats and some Republicans of not being tough enough on Putin, particularly during a jovial 2018 meeting in Helsinki between the two leaders. 
This time, there were separate news conferences and no shared meal. 
Both Biden and Putin said they shared a responsibility, however, for nuclear stability, and would hold talks on possible changes to their recently extended New START arms limitation treaty. 
In February, Russia and the United States extended New START for five years. The treaty caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads they can deploy and limits the land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers to deliver them. 
A senior US official told reporters that Biden, Putin, their foreign ministers and interpreters met first for 93 minutes. After a break, the two sides met for 87 minutes in a larger group including their ambassadors. 
Putin said it was ""hard to say"" if relations would improve, but that there was a ""glimpse of hope."" 
“This is not about trust, this is about self-interest and verification of self-interest,” Biden said, but he also cited a “genuine prospect” of improving relations.

Biden, Putin Discuss Post-Withdrawal Afghanistan
","
US President Joe Biden on Wednesday at a press conference in Switzerland after meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin said that he discussed Afghanistan with the Russian president.
Biden said he expressed an “unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine” and discussed the US and Russia’s shared interest in preventing “a resurgence of terrorism in Afghanistan.""
A reporter asked Biden if he had put questions about Afghanistan to Putin, and Biden replied:
“No, he asked us about Afghanistan. He said that he hopes that we’re able to maintain some peace and security, and I said, 'That has a lot to do with you.'""
“He indicated that he was prepared to, quote, 'help' on Afghanistan — I won’t go into detail now; and help on — on Iran; and help on — and, in return, we told him what we wanted to do relative to bringing some stability and economic security or physical security to the people of Syria and Libya,” he said.
 “So, we had those discussions,” he added.
On Monday, Biden at a press conference after the NATO leaders’ summit in Brussels said “there was a strong consensus in the room, among the leaders, in that meeting, on Afghanistan,” and he reiterated that the alliance will continue its support to Afghans after the withdrawal of international troops from the country.
“Our troops are coming home, but we agreed that our diplomatic, economic, and humanitarian commitment to the Afghan people and our support for the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces will endure,” Biden said.
“And I welcomed our Allies and partners to recognize that counterterrorism — that counterterrorism efforts must continue to ensure that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for attacks on our countries,” he said.
On Monday, the NATO leaders at the Brussels summit agreed to maintain funding for the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul after the Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan ends.
Addressing a press conference after the summit, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the RS mission is ending but NATO will continue supporting Afghanistan in four ways: funding Afghan forces, out-of-country training for Afghan forces, a continued civilian presence, and maintaining ""critical infrastructure"" such as the Kabul airport.
NATO leaders in a statement issued from the Brussels summit affirmed their commitment to continue to stand with Afghanistan, its people, and its institutions in promoting security and upholding the hard-won gains of the last 20 years.
It added that NATO will retain a Senior Civilian Representative’s Office in Kabul to continue diplomatic engagement and enhance its partnership with Afghanistan.
Recognizing its importance to an enduring diplomatic and international presence, as well as to Afghanistan's connectivity with the world, NATO will provide transitional funding to ensure continued functioning of Hamid Karzai International Airport,"" said the statement.
“We will also step up dialogue on Afghanistan with relevant international and regional partners,” the statement said. “We continue to support the ongoing Afghan-owned and Afghan-led peace process, and call on all stakeholders to help Afghanistan foster a lasting inclusive political settlement that puts an end to violence; safeguards the human rights of Afghans, particularly women, children, and minorities; upholds the rule of law; and ensures that Afghanistan never again serves as a safe haven for terrorists.”

Taliban Close Key Routes in Paktia: Residents
","
Residents and members of the provincial council in Paktia, a province in eastern Afghanistan, on Wednesday reported that the Taliban has blocked a number of key highways connecting the center of the province to some districts including Zurmat and Zazai Aryoub.
The public is not able to travel to their home areas and supply routes for security forces have been cut off, residents said.
Security forces in Paktia said operations will soon be launched to reopen the routes.
“The ordinary people are facing lots of problems in their movements, they cannot go to the bazaar or consult a hospital,” said Samiullah Afghan, a resident of Zurmat district in Paktia. “There are patients in people’s homes, the people in Zurmat want the government to take swift action and reopen the routes,” he said.
“If Zurmat district falls it will have a major impact on the security in both provinces, either Paktia or Paktika,” said a resident.
Local officials said that if the present situation continues, security will worsen in neighboring provinces including Ghazni and Paktika.
“Road closures have a significant impact, including social and economic consequences, and also a political impact,” said Jannat Khan Samkanai, the secretary of Paktia's provincial council.
“We call on the government to reopen the way as soon as possible and to ensure the delivery of services to the people,” said Mohammadu-rahman Qaderi, a member of the Paktia provincial council.
“We have launched a joint clearance operation between the national army, NDS and national police. The operations will cover both sides of the highway around Gardiz and Zurmat. God willing, the entire highway will be cleared very soon,” said Nisar Ahmad Wardak, the head of Paktia's security department.

Amnesty Intl Calls for Probe of 'Deliberate' Civilian Killings
","
""The Afghan authorities must investigate and bring to justice the perpetrators of a brutal series of attacks amounting to war crimes that have killed at least 24 civilians in little over a week,"" said Amnesty International on Wednesday. 
Amnesty International cited the June 15 attack in which five health workers were killed and four others were injured after gunmen opened fire at various polio vaccination centers across the city of Jalalabad in Nangarhar province.
The incident comes shortly after two car bombs killed at least seven civilians and injured at least six others in a district of west part of Kabul on June 12. 
“The targeting of civilians with near total impunity continues unabated. While peace talks falter and preparations for the full withdrawal of international forces gathers pace, it’s Afghanistan’s civilians who are paying the brutal price of this conflict,” said Samira Hamidi, Amnesty International’s South Asia Campaigner. 
“The Afghan authorities must end this cycle of impunity by launching independent and effective investigations into these and other attacks on civilians and bring those responsible to justice. We urge all parties to the conflict to take all measures necessary to protect civilians and respect international humanitarian law. And we call on the international community to make the protection of civilians and of minorities a central component of their ongoing support of the peace process,” the report said.
On June 8, ten mine clearers working for the international humanitarian organization The Halo Trust in Baghlan province were killed in an attack that injured 16 others. 
Health workers, humanitarians, human rights defenders and journalists have been particularly targeted in a wave of assassinations since the start of peace talks in Doha last year, the report said.  
At least 24 have been killed since January  2021, including two doctors in separate attacks in northern Parwan and western Farah provinces in the past week. With the exception of one of the killings, no other investigations have taken place, and nobody has been brought to justice in any of the cases. 
This week’s attack on the polio vaccination centers in Jalalabad, which caused the vaccination drive to be suspended in Eastern Afghanistan, follows a similar attack in March which left three health workers in Nangarhar dead.  
Afghanistan and Pakistan are the only two countries in the world where polio remains endemic, according to authorities.

On Thursday, forty days after the attack on the Sayed al-Shuhada girls school in western Kabul, families of the victims called on the UN to launch an investigation into the brutal attack that killed at least 85 students and wounded 275 others.
Meanwhile, other students who survived the attack vowed to continue their education with even greater determination. 
“It is enough, the blood of many young people has been shed, many of them were buried along with desires and aspirations,” said Fatima, the mother of a student of the Sayed al-Shuhada girls school.
“Our hearts have burned, our children were martyred, our hopes have vanished, what should we do?” said Razia, the mother of a student who lost her life in the attack on May 8.
The attack started with a car bomb attack near the school and was followed by two other bomb blasts in the area.
“The incident was such a horrible attack that we cannot describe it in words,” said Aqila Tawakoli, the principal of Sayed al-Shuhada girls school.
“As the perpetrators of this attack have not yet been identified, we call for an investigation of the attack by a credible international institution,” said Sabar Gul, a teacher.

Past 24 Hours Sees Fighting in 200 Areas in Afghanistan
","
Statistics by the internal security commission of the Wolesi Jirga indicates that the Afghan National Security and Defense Forces (ANDSF) has engaged with the Taliban in 200 points in the past 24 hours.
Meanwhile, Afghanistan’s Ministry of Defense in a statement said that 148 Taliban fighters have been killed in fighting with Afghan security forces, and more than 160 others were wounded.
The Taliban claimed to have killed over 50 security force members and wounded dozens more.
The Taliban also claimed that they had taken over a key military base in the Shinkai district of Zabul.
In the meantime, footage went viral on social media showing the Taliban apparently accompanying a convoy of security forces in the Shinkai district of Zabul. 
Amrullah Saleh, the First Vice President of Afghanistan, said the footage was a ""pre-planned intelligence secret,"" and, in such moments, there is no need to disclose secrets of the operations in the name of freedom of expression and pave the way for the enemy to take advantage of the issue.
“Thoughtless speakers can say whatever they want. There is no doubt the country is passing through difficult days. At the same time, casualties among the ignorant and abhorrent group (Taliban) are three times higher than our security forces. Do not trust in propaganda,” said Saleh in a Facebook post.
“You must represent the courage and determination of the security and defense forces of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. You must be the spokesmen of the bravery and resistance of the country’s forces. Whatever was written about Zabul so far has not been real,” added Saleh.
“The question of why are they accompanying the Taliban, there is something vague behind it politically,” said Nasrullah Ziarmal, a former military officer. 
“This shows that the collapse (of the outpost) occurred due to a deal,” said Shabanah Khoshal, a civil society activist in Zabul.
“The head of security and the deputy governor went there to help and all the military equipment was left behind for the enemy-- this was a political surrender,” said Atta Jan Haqbayan, the head of Zabul provincial council.
The Taliban claimed they have seized all of the entire military equipment from the base.
“The equipment left behind is not useable,” said Abdul Matin Hassankhel, deputy commander of the 205 Atal Army Corps.
The Taliban also claimed to have taken over a military base in Bagahwi village of Sar-e-Pul province in northern Afghanistan and to have seized over 50 different types of military equipment.
Meanwhile, Sibghatullah Selab, the deputy head of the Faryab provincial council, said that the center of Shireen Tagab district had fallen to the Taliban this afternoon.
He said that the Taliban had sent a message to the security forces in the area to lay down their arms and surrender.
According to Selab, the Taliban have transferred the soldiers to an unknown location.
He said that the Taliban took 160 pieces of military equipment, including vehicles such as ""Humvees and Rangers.""
TOLOnews’ reporter did not manage to obtain a comment from the 209 Shaheen Army Corps.
Over the past two months, the government has lost 30 districts to the Taliban, which makes up 8 percent of the country.
Previously, the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) said that 210 districts, which makes up 54 percent of the entire territory in Afghanistan, are under the control of the government, 132 districts are contested and 46 districts are under Taliban control.
The fallen districts are Oba in Herat; Shahrak, Tolak and Saghar in Ghor; Poshtrod and Lash Jawin in Farah; Jond and Murghab in Badghis; Dawlat Abad and Qaisar in Faryab; Sayyad and Sozma Qala in Sar-e-Pul; Burka in Baghlan; Ashkamash in Takhar;  Zare in Balkh; Washir in Helmand; Arghistan in Kandahar; Shinkai and Arghandab in Zabul; Chinarto and Gizab in Uruzgan; Duab and Mandol in Nuristan; Arghanchkhaw in Badakhshan; Dahyak, Jaghato, Rashidan and Ab Band in Ghazni; Charkh in Logar; Nerkh and Jalrez in Maidan Wardak and Dawlat Shah in Laghman.
“Those who are planning the war, their planning has lots of shortcomings, supply is not taking place properly,” said Mohammad Radmanish.
With the expansion of war in 24 provinces of Afghanistan, the fundamental question is how to prevent the present situation?
“The government should put aside its internal problems and should consult everyone so that we move out of this situation,” said MP Khan Agha Rezayee.
In Balkh province, reports say the Taliban has detonated a Humvee full of explosives near the police headquarters in Dawlat Abad.

MPs Question Suitability, Behavior of Country’s Security Chiefs
","
Lawmakers in Afghanistan’s Wolesi Jirga—the lower house of Parliament-- on Thursday criticized the government for the uncertainty around the leadership of the Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Interior, saying it is one of the key factors behind the surge of violence in the country.
MPs noted that the Interior Ministry has been run by a caretaker for the past three months and that the defense minister is again traveling following a previous long stay abroad.
Sources have said that aides from Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the High Council of National Reconciliation, are in talks with President Ashraf Ghani's aides about finalizing a suitable candidate to take charge of the Ministry of Interior.
“In such a scenario, negligence or absenteeism raises questions and is unforgivable,” said Saleh Mohammad Registani, a military expert.
“We decided in the morning to conduct a meeting with the security officials, but we do not know when and with whom--the people responsible are not there,” said MP Shagofa Noorizai.
This comes after Defense Minister Assadullah Khalid returned to Kabul after a six-month trip abroad but stayed only for a few days before traveling again.
In a recent move, the government also appointed former deputy minister of interior for security General Abdul Saboor Qane as the new governor of Herat province.
“The fate of the acting minister of interior remains uncertain, the deputy minister of interior for security is not there, there is no defense minister here, there are lots of problems, all these have an impact on the war,” said MP Mir Afghan Safai.
Some reshufflings have also occurred in several posts in the National Directorate of Security (NDS).

The Taliban on Wednesday night launched an offensive on the Zinda Jan district of Herat in western Afghanistan and managed to burn some parts of the police headquarters after five hours of fierce fighting with Afghan security forces.
Local officials in Herat said the Afghan National Security and Defense Forces (ANDSF) fought bravely and repulsed the Taliban attack.
“Lack of coordination between the security forces is a serious problem. There is a need for a unified command and control center to provide morale to the security forces. The Taliban are using these gaps and then launching attacks,” said Ghulam Habib Hashemi, a member of Herat’s security committee.

Militant Groups in Afghanistan Could Pose Threat to US: Officials
","
Top Pentagon officials on Thursday said that militant groups like al Qaeda could pose a threat from Afghanistan to the United States and American allies in two years after the full withdrawal of international troops from the country.
US President Joe Biden’s decision to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan in the next few months has been accompanied by concerns about Afghanistan’s future, especially when it comes to containing threats from terrorist groups in the country.
“It would take possibly two years for them to develop that capability,” US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said during a congressional hearing on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Gen. Mark Milley, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he agreed with the timeline and said there was a medium risk at the moment.
“If there was a collapse of the government or a dissolution of the Afghan security forces, that risk would obviously increase,” Milley said.
The remarks come as a UN report in January said there are at least 500 al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan and that the Taliban maintains a close relationship with the group. The Taliban has denied having ties with al Qaeda.
Also, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan meanwhile said on Thursday that they take the issue seriously that militant groups in Afghanistan will pose threat to the west.
“Obviously, we take seriously the concern that the Taliban or other elements in Afghanistan will attack the Western — or the international presence — diplomatic presence or security presence in and around Kabul. That’s why we are putting together a detailed and effective security plan,” Sullivan said.
This comes as violence has intensified following the start of the withdrawal of US and coalition forces from Afghanistan. A parliamentary committee on Thursday reported fighting on 200 fronts across the country in just a day. Moreover, at least 30 districts have fallen to the Taliban in the last two months.

Political Leaders Asked to Focus on National Issues

Amidst a sharp increase in violence some critics and a member of the reconciliation council on Friday said that further disagreement among political leaders will worsen the situation, suggesting that there should be more focus on building consensus on national issues.  
Violence has remained high in the country following US President Joe Biden’s announcement of withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. The Ministry of Defense on Friday reported clashes in 13 provinces in the last 24 hours. 
“Hundreds of Afghan youth are killed on both sides every day. The situation is moving towards a wrong direction,” said Hafizurrahman Naqi, a member of Hizb-e-Islami. 
“Unfortunately, the current leaders of Afghanistan prefer their personal interest to national interests; therefore, we don’t have consensus,” said Ahmad Saeedi, a political commentator. 
Some Kabul residents interviewed by TOLOnews on Friday said the government leaders should think about the people, not their “personal interests.” They said to overcome the current crisis, political and government leaders should focus on unity. 
“They don’t care even if the people die or remain alive. They only think about their positions and to fill their pockets,” said Omid, a Kabul resident. 
 “They should put aside their personal interests and should focus on national issues and work to get the country out of the challenges,” said Arian, a Kabul resident. 
Amir Mohammad A member of the High Council for National Reconciliation, meanwhile, said the current rifts among Afghan politicians are “disappointing.” 
“There is no love for the country in the minds of these people. I am not optimistic that they will create political consensus,” said Amir Mohammad Akhundzada, a member of the High Council for National Reconciliation.

Clashes were reported in 13 provinces in the last 24 hours with security forces evacuating two districts in the north while retaking control of one district in the south on Thursday night.

Abdullah Doubts Taliban’s Intention for a Political Settlement
","
Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, has said that he has grave concerns that the Taliban will not show any flexibility for a political agreement with the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan once the US troops leave the country.
Abdullah said there clear are indications that show that the Taliban are trying to advance militarily before the withdrawal of foreign forces from the country.
“The point is that it will have an implication, an impact on the negotiations with the Taliban. Taliban may find themselves further emboldened and they may think, some of them at least, that with the withdrawal they can take advantage of the situation militarily, so why to get seriously into the negotiations?"",” said Abdullah in an interview with AP.
Abdullah however warned the Taliban not to miscalculate the situation, saying that no one will be able to win militarily.
“It will be a big miscalculation on part of the Taliban should they think that they can win militarily, and I repeat that there are no winners through the continuation of the war,” he added in the interview.
Meanwhile, Qatar’s Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said that there has been no breakthrough in the peace negotiations between the Afghan parties so far.
“The announcement of the withdrawal of the US forces that will be in September 2021, which is in three months from now, and yet there is not an Afghan consensus how the future of Afghanistan will look like,"" he said. ""Our main goals now is to achieve a ceasefire between the government and the Taliban and to achieve a consensus among the different Afghan parties."" 
In an address to Antalya Diplomacy Forum in Turkey on Friday, Abdullah called on the Taliban to engage in talks, reiterating that there is a “real opportunity” for peace in the country that should be utilized. 
This comes amid reports that a six-member team from the Afghan Republic comprising key political leaders, including Abdullah Abdullah and former president Hamid Karzai, is expected to travel to Doha within the next few days to hold talks with the Taliban. The delegation is expected to visit Doha on Wednesday.
The Taliban has said that they welcome the delegation’s efforts for peace.

Qureshi Rejects Taliban Sanctuaries in Pakistan
","
Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said the only way forward toward peace in Afghanistan is through reconciliation, coexistence and talks among Afghans, and he reiterated that Islamabad’s approach toward its neighbor has changed and it will favor a future arrangement that is acceptable for all Afghans. 
Talking to TOLOnews in an exclusive interview at his office in Islamabad last week, Qureshi said there is a need for flexibility from Afghan leaders to move the peace process forward.
Qureshi rejected Taliban sanctuaries in Pakistan and said most of their leaders “are in Afghanistan” and when asked about the presence of Quetta and Peshawar Shuras, or councils, he denied the existence of such institutions in Pakistan and said he “has been hearing of these terms for now decades.”
Asked whether Taliban are ""funded here in Pakistan,"" Qureshi said: “These are very--those many things that have been going on for years. You’re stuck in the old groove. Get of out that groove, please. Get out of that groove. Now, listen, if you remain stuck in this, believe me you will not be able to travel far. And we want you to travel far. We want reconciliation and peace.”
Qureshi, seemingly skeptical about further progress in the peace process under the current circumstances, said President Ghani has ""a very important responsibility on his shoulders"" and he must ""show the leadership and the flexibility” necessary to achieve progress in the peace process.
Qureshi mentioned Doha as the best place for engaging in talks with the Taliban--even between the leaders of both sides--but said this will not happen unless there is willingness from both sides.
“What has changed is Pakistan’s approach,” Qureshi stressed. “We want Afghanistan to be peaceful and stable because we feel that a peaceful Afghanistan, a stable Afghanistan, gives us the regional connectivity that is required.”
“If we’re looking for economic security and if we’re looking for investments and the promotion of bilateral trade and regional trade, it can only come with peace, and peace and stability Afghanistan is not just Afghanistan’s requirement, it’s Pakistan’s desire as well. You know, we benefit from it,” he said.
According to Qureshi, the world’s approach has changed as it does not hold the view that peace can be achieved through a military solution.
“We have been advocating for years that there is no military solution to the Afghan conflict. What has changed is this new approach that what is required is a negotiated political settlement that we were advocating. This international environment has changed and that has been the environment more conducive for peace today than ever before.""
In response to a question on what type of a government Pakistan would favor as an outcome of the peace process, Qureshi said it is a decision to be made by Afghans.
“That’s for the people of Afghanistan to decide--who governs them and what kind of a political dispensation Afghanistan wants,” he said. “What we’re saying is you are all Afghans. Peace can only come to Afghanistan if you sit and reconcile. When you sit and reconcile, when you sit and talk, you will determine what kind of constitution we want, what kind of, you know, system should be in place.”
He said that Pakistan suggests an inclusive system that would be helpful in reconciliation and promoting the peace process.
“We’re willing to help; we’re willing to help in pushing forward the peace process, and as you know we’ve facilitated the peace process and there is acknowledgement of that. We’re willing to help in Afghanistan’s reconstruction, rehabilitation. We’re willing to partner with Afghanistan, with the US, on countering terrorism. Yes, we will be partners for peace,” he said.
When asked about the status of the Afghan peace process and progress in this respect, Qureshi said it should be asked of Afghans.
“The peace process has to come to its logical conclusion through an intra-Afghan negotiation. We’re not sitting at the table with them. Wherever required, we’ve facilitated. We cannot decide for you. It’s the Afghans that will sit and decide what they want,” he said.
Taliban-Pakistan Nexus 
Qureshi said that Taliban leaders and those who have attended the Doha negotiations, including Mullah Baradar, have been visiting talks “for facilitating the peace process,” and he reiterated that most Taliban leaders “are in Afghanistan.”
“They (Taliban leaders) go to Doha. They have been traveling to other places, they went to Moscow, they went to other places,” Qureshi said.
Referring to Taliban leaders, he said, they’re in Afghanistan and the Afghans “need to engage with them.”
“We’re only engaging with them to facilitate the peace process,” he said. “We’re trying to be helpful. We’re trying to be constructive.”
Qureshi said that Pakistan has “always advocated reduction in violence leading to ceasefire because we genuinely believe that you cannot have negotiations and violence go hand in hand.”
Qureshi indirectly hinted that he does not see the Taliban as responsible for the high level of violence in Afghanistan.
“Who is responsible for that?” Qureshi said when he was asked about the rise in Taliban violence. “If you try (to) create this impression that the violence is high because of Taliban, again, that would be an exaggeration.”
He said there are other elements like Daesh “who are playing the role of a spoiler.”
He said that violence has to go down and the process of peace and negotiations has to accelerate.
He said he thinks that the Taliban are ready for peace and that “they have suffered as well.”
Qureshi said that he has talked with those Taliban leaders who are in talks with Afghans.
“I am talking to exactly the people you are talking to. The people you are talking to in Doha, the people you are talking to while sitting across the table, same people. I feel they also realize that they have suffered and they have paid a huge price. And it’s their country. They are not foreigners,” he said.
Qureshi said that Pakistan remains concerned that Afghanistan will be plunged into another civil war, but he hopes it will not happen.
“That’s why I’m saying, please sit together and carve out a way forward, you know, which is coexistence, reconciliation. Accept each other. You have to accept each other,” he asked.
In response to a question about whether the country is moving toward a civil war, Qureshi said it depends on the Afghan leadership.
“It depends on you, depends on the Afghan leadership, depends on the ability of the Afghan leadership to carve a way forward. If you fail, if the Afghan leadership fail, then yes, we are heading for a civil war,” he added.
Afghanistan-Pakistan Relations
Qureshi said that Pakistan wants a sovereign, democratic and peaceful Afghanistan.
“Bilateral relationships are mutual. Both sides have to see a benefit in it, and we do see. We see benefit in good relations with Afghanistan,” Qureshi said.
But he added that “Pakistan is not responsible for the squabbling that is going on in Afghanistan.”
“Pakistan is not responsible if the Afghan leadership cannot sit and work out a peace deal. We’re not responsible for that. It’s yours. We’re saying we want to be helpful.”
Regarding the Durand Line, specifically, whether it is a recognized border, Qureshi said: “If we want to move ahead and sort of coexist as good neighbors that we desire then I think let’s accept the international border.”
India-Pakistan Ties
Qureshi said that India has a presence in Afghanistan that is ""larger than it ought to be"" because it does not share a border with Afghanistan. He said that India uses its presence to conduct “subversive activities” in Pakistan.
Qureshi said that officially India has four consulates in Afghanistan, but indirectly hinted there are more unofficial ones.
“At times we feel that you don’t share a border with India. Obviously, you have sovereign relations and you have bilateral relations and you have every right to have sovereign and bilateral relations with India. You trade with India, they come and carry out development work there. That’s fine, that’s completely fine with us. But at times we feel that their presence is perhaps larger than it ought to be because they don’t share a border with you.”
He said it bothers Pakistan if Afghan soil is used against it by India.
He said that under Prime Minister Imran Khan, they took initiatives toward peace with India, but it was not reciprocated by New Delhi.
“They took steps and measures that vitiated the climate,” Qureshi said, referring to India. “Despite that, we think that the situation in occupied Jammu and Kashmir is a political situation, it is being mishandled.”
Qureshi meanwhile rejected reports about Pakistan’s willingness to allow US bases to operate on Pakistani soil after American forces leave Afghanistan. He said it will never be possible.
Regarding US withdrawal, he said the United States believes that it has achieved its objective in Afghanistan and that it is leaving the country.

Afghan Government Unveils Major Security Shake-Up as War Rages On
","
The Afghan government on Saturday announced the appointment of Gen. Bismillah Khan Mohammadi as new acting minister of defense and Gen. Abdul Sattar Mirzakwal as acting minister of interior, a major shake-up in the country’s security sector in the middle of surging violence that has been gripping Afghanistan on various fronts.
President Ghani also appointed Gen. Wali Mohammad Ahmadzai as the new army chief, replacing Gen. Yasin Zia who was serving in the post since last July.
Hayatullah Hayat who served as acting minister of interior has been appointed as acting minister of rural rehabilitation and urban development, according to a statement by the Presidential Palace.
Bismillah Mohammad has previously served as minister of defense, minister of interior, and chief of army staff under former president Hamid Karzai's administration.
Assadullah Khalid was serving in the post since December 2018. He resigned from his post as defense minister last week.
The High Council for National Reconciliation has said that Bismillah Mohammadi was appointed to the post in an agreement between President Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the reconciliation council.
This new development takes place at a time that the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces continue to fight the Taliban in various regions and amidst the withdrawal of US and NATO forces from the country.
In the latest incidents of violence, there are reports that the Taliban have captured the center of Baharak and Bangi districts in Takhar province, Khawja Sabzposh district in Faryab, Mardian district in Jawzjan, Dara-e-Soof district in Samangan, Qala Kah district in Farah and Mirzaka district in Paktia.
Sources have confirmed that at least 30 districts have either fallen to the Taliban or have been evacuated by security forces over the last two months.
Some lawmakers said the Taliban will launch attacks on major cities if the government does not take immediate action to retake the areas that have fallen to the group. 
“Last night, the police chief of Khawja Sabzposh district (in Takhar) phoned (me) for air support and refused to retreat and vowed to fight. They waited until midnight. When pressure mounted, they surrendered to the Taliban,” said Fawzia Raufi, an MP from Faryab.
“If weapons and other military equipment aren’t supplied to Omarkhel, Lajmangal, and Aryoub districts (in Paktia in eastern Afghanistan), they will face the same fate as the Mirzaka district (in Paktia),” said Taj Mohammad Mangal, member of the provincial council Paktia
“Other neighboring districts like Baharak and Bangi and even the city of Taluqan will fall if the clashes continue at the same pace and if the central government does not pay attention to Takhar,” said Nazifa Yousuf Bek, an MP from Takhar.
“Unfortunately, the situation is getting worse every day. The Taliban’s activities have increased. Mardian district (in Jawzjan) fell to the Taliban last night,” said Babur Aidin, a civil society activist in Jawzjan.
The Ministry of Defense on Friday confirmed clashes in at least 13 districts.
The Defense Ministry said the ANDSF will soon retake all those areas that have fallen to the Taliban.
“This situation will not prevail,"" a Defense Ministry spokesman Fawad Aman assured.
Although there reports that at least 50 security force members have been killed during the battles with the Taliban in the past 24 hours, the Defense Ministry has said that over 250 Taliban were killed and 161 more were wounded in clashes in the same period. Taliban has rejected the figures.

Spanta Urges Political Unity to Support Afghan Forces
","
Former foreign minister and former national security adviser Rangin Dadfar Spanta on Saturday asked Afghan political leaders to come together and unite in support of Afghanistan's National Defense and Security Forces. He said this will help to reduce casualties among security forces as the fighting intensifies on multiple fronts.
Speaking at the funeral ceremony of Lieut. Colonel Sohrab Azimi, a member of Afghan Special Forces who lost his life last week in the battle with the Taliban, Spanta said that the current situation of the country is quite fragile.
“It is now the right time that we come together and defend the blood of our martyrs, our flag,"" Spanta said. ""We should not let the aggressors and 'the fifth pillar' elements achieve their evil end.""
Analysts said that poor management in the leadership of the country's security institutions and the absence of comprehensive plans are two key factors behind the rise in casualties among government forces.
“We are facing a management gap. From the military perspective, it is a mistake when you send a group or a unit to a district and you don't provide them air and ground support,” said retired Gen. Zahir Azimi, father of Sohrab Azimi.
“This shows weakness because did not receive air or ground support,” said military analyst Mohammad Radmanish.
Fighting has intensified on multiple fronts amidst the withdrawal of the US and coalition forces from Afghanistan. The Ministry of Defense reported clashes in at least 13 provinces in the last 24 hours while  
“Anyone who commits negligence should be punished,” said Shams-Ur-Rahman, a Kabul resident.
“They (ANDSF) are defending, and they offer sacrifices. Those who commit negligence must be punished,” said Mohammad Osman, a Kabul resident.
The Defense Ministry said the Afghan forces will soon retake all those areas that have fallen to the Taliban.
“The more our security forces are engaged in war and confront the enemy, the most the enemy will suffer,” said Fawad Aman, deputy spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.

Interview with Pakistan FM Qureshi: Full Transcript
","
TOLOnews’ Lotfullah Najafizada sits down with Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi to discuss the Afghan peace process, Afghanistan-Pakistan relations, Pakistan’s ties with India and other current topics. 
Full text:
Najafizada: Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi of Pakistan, thank you for your time. 
Qureshi: Pleasure.
Najafizada: Let's start with the positive news. You say that the policy towards Afghanistan has changed. What has changed?
Qureshi: You see, what has changed is Pakistan’s approach. We want Afghanistan to be peaceful and stable because we feel that a peaceful Afghanistan, a stable Afghanistan, gives us the regional connectivity that is required. If we’re looking for economic security and if we’re looking for investments and promotion of bilateral trade and regional trade, it can only come with peace, and peace and stability Afghanistan is not just Afghanistan’s requirement; it’s Pakistan’s desire as well. You know, we benefit from it.
Najafizada: It was not the strategy before?
Qureshi: It was.
Najafizada: So, what has changed?
Qureshi: What has changed is the approach of the world, you know. People were of the view that peace could be achieved through a military solution. It has not. We have been advocating for years that there is no military solution to the Afghan conflict. What has changed is this new approach that what is required is a negotiated political settlement that we were advocating. This international environment has changed and that has been the environment more conducive for peace today than ever before.
Najafizada: Former Pakistan prime minister Yousaf Raza Gillani addressing the Pakistani parliament once said that there was a state within a state which was not allowing the civilian government here to do its works. Has that changed?
Qureshi: I think Mr. Gillani when he made that statement it was out of perhaps political considerations, and as prime minister, he should have known that he is the chief executive of the country and the chief executive of the country under the constitution controls all institutions, all institutions of the government report and function under the constitution and he is the chief executive of the country. I can speak for the institutions and how things are being run today. All institutions are in harmony with the government. We’re on the same page. Obviously, we have consultations, we discuss, and we take an input from all state institutions and then the institutions carry out a policy of the government.
Najafizada: Right. So Pakistan wants a stable, democratic and sovereign Afghanistan?
Qureshi: Certainly.
Najafizada: And is that only possible with a state in Afghanistan to be run by the Taliban? Does it have to? 
Qureshi: No, no no. That’s for the people of Afghanistan to decide who governs them and what kind of a political dispensation Afghanistan wants? That is your decision. That is the decision of the people of Afghanistan. What we’re saying is you are all Afghans. Peace can only come to Afghanistan if you sit and reconcile. When you sit and reconcile, when you sit and talk, you will determine what kind of constitution we want, what kind of you know system should be in place. All we’re suggesting is that an inclusive system – 
Najafizada: Where all ethnic groups should be represented and?
Qureshi: Would be helpful in reconciliation and promoting the peace process.
Najafizada: And Pakistan wants to deal with central government in Kabul?
Qureshi: We want to deal with the government chosen by the people of Afghanistan.
Najafizada: through elections?
Qureshi: Obviously, we believe in democracy and would want a democratic order in Afghanistan. We have always said we support a sovereign, independent, democratic Afghanistan.
Najafizada: You invite Afghan political party leaders back-to-back. Isn’t that challenging the central authority in Afghanistan?
Qureshi: Not at all. It is just to promote a better understanding. There were misperceptions and a lot of you know talk that Pakistan is just concentrating on a particular faction, particular school of thought. No, we want to engage with everyone, we want to be friends with everyone, we want to be friends with Afghanistan and the people of Afghanistan. Now, Afghanistan have different ethnic groups. We want to engage with all of them for a better understanding.
Najafizada: Mr. Foreign Minister, are you or Afghanistan and Pakistan are working on a strategic partnership agreement? Is that happening?
Qureshi: Well, what we want to, what we have agreed to, is a mechanism called APAPS. We realized that there are issues that are there and will always be there. We must have a structured, institutionalized mechanism in place so that whenever they arrive, we can bilaterally sit, talk about them.
Najafizada: Is that functioning?
Qureshi: It is functioning, but we can use it more effectively. In my view, we have not used it as effectively as we could have.
Najafizada: Have you offered the Afghan security forces to be trained in Pakistan?
Qureshi: We will be more than happy. We will be more than happy.
Najafizada: What is the response you’re getting from Kabul?
Qureshi: Well, they never say no, but they haven’t yet taken our offers seriously. We honestly feel that we can be of assistance, you know, your cadets coming here, your diplomats coming here, getting training in the Foreign Service Academy, in our military institutions. We can be of service. We speak the same language, you know, culturally, we have so many similarities. They will feel at home.
Najafizada: Before coming to the peace process, and the Taliban in particular, lets briefly discuss the war on terror. Is America defeated?
Qureshi: Well, the Americans have said that they have achieved their objective and their objective was to break the back of international terrorist organizations and to protect mainland United States. They feel in these 20 years, they have succeeded in the objective that they had set forth and it’s time to go back home, and they feel that the Afghan government and the Taliban that they negotiated a peace agreement in Doha have very openly agreed that Afghan soil will not be used against the US or any other country.
Najafizada: What do you think? You think America is leaving Afghanistan with pride and it’s a proud departure?
Qureshi: Well, they came with an objective, and they feel that their objective has been met. Obviously, they couldn’t be here indefinitely. They had to go way soon or later.
Najafizada: And you are happy that they are leaving Afghanistan?
Qureshi: Well, obviously, they can’t be here forever. They had to leave and if they are satisfied that they have achieved their objectives, then we are okay with that.
Najafizada: General Hamid Gul of ISI once said, “the ISI with the help of America defeated America.” How would you respond to that?
Qureshi: I do not understand in what context that statement is made so, you know, if you pick up two lines, I do not know the background and what context that statement was made, so how can I comment on it?
Najafizada: America defeated and ISI helped. It is very simple.
Qureshi: America defeated how, by whom?
Najafizada: By the Taliban.
Qureshi: He is no longer here with us, you know. So I cannot verify what you’re saying, but I think the Americans came for a purpose, they feel that they have achieved that purpose, not just one, both administrations.
Najafizada: And you have an understanding what the US? – 
Qureshi: Can I complete? Both administrations, the republicans under Trump administration, felt the time had come to leave and the present administration, the democratic party, under President Biden has re-endorsed that after review, after careful examination have come to an inclusion the time to leave has come.
Najafizada: And you have an understanding with the US as they leave Afghanistan?
Qureshi: Do they need our understanding? It’s their decision. It’s decision.
Najafizada: That you can help with them in the case there are more threats coming from Afghanistan?
Qureshi: You see, we’re willing to help, we’re willing to help in pushing forward the peace process and as you know we’ve facilitated the peace process and there is acknowledgement of that. We’re willing to help in Afghanistan’s reconstruction, rehabilitation. We’re willing to partner with Afghanistan, with the US, on countering terrorism. Yes, we will be partners for peace.
Najafizada: Will you be giving them basis inside Pakistan as they leave Afghanistan?
Qureshi: No
Najafizada: Intelligence? Military?
Qureshi: I said no bases.
Najafizada: No drones, none?
Qureshi: No.
Najafizada: Mr. Foreign Minister, have you seen the secret annexes that the US and Taliban made? The two secret documents apart from what was announced publicly in Doha?
Qureshi: Well, I’ve seen what was shared with us.
Najafizada: The annexes or the main document? 
Qureshi: Main document.
Najafizada: Lets come back to the peace process which I believe is very important at this stage. Where are we in the Afghan peace process? Any progress is being made?
Qureshi: Where are you? How can we say where are we? You know, it’s the Afghans. The peace process has to come to its logical conclusion through an intra-Afghan negotiation. We’re not sitting on the table with them. Wherever required, we’ve facilitated. We cannot decide for you. It’s the Afghans that will sit and decide what they want.
Najafizada: The Afghans who are living here, the Afghan who are in Pakistan, the Taliban I mean, the Taliban leaders.
Qureshi: No, unfortunately. I am not saying they do not have relations here, but the bulk of their leadership, and I say this in confidence, is not living in Pakistan, in fact, is living in Afghanistan.
Najafizada: The Doha negotiators, the Taliban negotiators, are coming to Pakistan they said publicly for consultations. Mullah Baradar has come here so many times. They go to Quetta.
Qureshi: For facilitating the peace process.
Najafizada: To check on their fighters in hospitals in Quetta.
Qureshi: They go to Doha. They have been traveling to other places, they went to Moscow, they went to other places.
Najafizada: We haven’t seen videos of them coming to Helmand, Kabul or Kandahar.
Qureshi: They’re in Afghanistan. You need to engage with them. We’re only engaging with them to facilitate the peace process. We’re trying to be helpful. We’re trying to be constructive. You know, many have started to recognizing that internationally, but there are some in Afghanistan who still have that mental blockage of accepting the fact that Pakistan is being genuine, is being constructive and is sincere because Pakistan feels it is Pakistan’s enlightened interest that there is peace and stability in Afghanistan. Why can’t people in Afghanistan understand that, why can’t people in Afghanistan, you know – I think people of Afghanistan understand that, generally speaking, because the people of Afghanistan in my view want peace. They have had enough of war.
Najafizada: Of course, the violence is very high Mr. foreign minister.
Qureshi: They’ve had enough of war. They’ve had for decades.
Najafizada: There are more violence these days.
Qureshi: Unfortunately, it should go down and we’ve always advocated – 
Najafizada: How can it go down?
Qureshi: We’ve always advocated reduction in violence leading to ceasefire because we genuinely believe that you cannot have negotiations and violence go hand in hand. You know, violence has to go down and the process of peace and negotiations has to accelerate.
Najafizada: When they have a presence here, they have a freedom of movement, they do the recruitment here, fundraising, they go to Pakistani hospitals. All these are lies?
Qureshi: You’re still stuck in the past.
Najafizada: Are these are lies? These are not correct?
Qureshi: These are exaggerations.
Najafizada: What is the truth?
Qureshi: Exaggerations I’ve said. You are still… See, the problem is until and unless you reconcile with the fact. Now, What’s happening today? Unfortunately, allow me to say this, when things are not moving in the right direction, you’re looking for the scapegoats and the favorite scapegoat you have is Pakistan. When there’s failure within, you blame Pakistan for that. Pakistan is not responsible for the failure within. Pakistan is not responsible for the squabbling that is going on in Afghanistan. Pakistan is not responsible if the Afghan leadership cannot sit and work out a peace deal. We’re not responsible for that. It’s yours. We’re saying we want to be helpful.
Najafizada: Are the Taliban ready for peace, Mr. Foreign Minister?
Qureshi: I think they are. They also, they have suffered as well.
Najafizada: They have taken 30 districts in the past two months. Is that a sign of peace?
Qureshi: Well… the Afghan National Army and the Afghan security forces have to deal with that situation. The international community has spent a lot of money in equipping and training the Afghan security forces, right? And you are far exceeding in numbers, you know, compared to the Taliban. That’s the perception one has. So, why don’t you do your soul-searching what is going wrong?
Najafizada: The question is the intention of the Taliban? Do they want peace or they want war?
Qureshi: I think, I think, in the interactions that I’ve had with them.
Najafizada: Who you talk to? You talk to (Mullah) Baradar? You talk to?
Qureshi: The people, the political community that you are talking to.
Najafizada: You talk to Siraj?
Qureshi: You’re talking, you’re taking – I am talking to exactly the people you are talking to. The people you are talking to in Doha, the people you are talking to while sitting across the table, same people. I feel they also realize that they have suffered and there have paid a huge price. And it’s their country. They are not foreigners! 
Najafizada: Of course.
Qureshi: They’re Afghans. Don’t you think they want peace in Afghanistan? Don’t you think they want stability in Afghanistan? I don’t carry their brief but it’s logical. I mean if there was a disturbance in Pakistan, every Pakistani would want peace and stability here.
Najafizada: Yes, but the violence is very high and they’re taking over territories?
Qureshi: Who is responsible for that? Who is responsible for that? You think, now, again, again, if you try and create this impression that the violence is high because of Taliban, again, that would be an exaggeration. Why do I say that? Aren’t there other elements over there who are playing the role of a spoiler? 
Najafizada: Like who? 
Qureshi: Daesh. Like forces within Afghanistan. 
Najafizada: Who?
Qureshi: Who came from the war economy. Who want to perpetuate their power, who are not seeing beyond their nose and just want to hang on to power.
Najafizada: President Ghani is in power. 
 Qureshi: Sorry? 
Najafizada: President Ghani is in power. Are you implying that he doesn’t want peace? 
Qureshi: What I know, I will not say that, but I think President Ghani has a very important responsibility on his shoulders that he has to show the leadership and the flexibility to achieve… 
Najafizada: What does that mean? What does flexibility mean? To Step down? 
Qureshi: That is for him to decide, but what I’m saying is – 
Najafizada: When you say flexibility…
Qureshi: Flexibility to reach a peace deal.  
Najafizada: How? 
Qureshi: It is for you do decide. I can’t tell you what to do, but if both sides, listen, if the Taliban stick to their position, right, and the President Ashraf Ghani and his core team stick to their position, will there be peace in Afghanistan? You tell me. Will there be peace? There will be no peace. Don’t you want peace? 
Najafizada: Of course. 
Qureshi: The Afghan people want peace. Why can’t the leadership of Afghanistan understand that people are sick and tired of war. People are fatigued, people are tired, people have lost children and families. 
Najafizada: Mr. Foreign Minister, you are right, but the question is that the Taliban is also part of the war. 
Qureshi: Yes. 
Najafizada: Are they showing any signs of peace and flexibility?
Qureshi: What I’m saying is they also want peace. 
Najafizada: How do you know? 
Qureshi: Because in the interactions we’ve had. 
Najafizada: But actions demonstrate something else. No? 
Qureshi: Well, see, again, I cannot sort of get involved in the discussions that are going on between the Afghan government and the Taliban. 
Najafizada: There is no discussion. 
Qureshi: There were discussions. There’s a stalemate at the moment and I hope you can get over the stalemate because if stalemate continues, and the withdrawal is completed, unfortunately, you will be sacked back into the 90s, which is not good for Afghanistan, which is not good for Pakistan, and which is not good for the region. Can Afghanistan afford another civil war? Can you afford another, you know, a decade of anarchy? You cannot, and you should not. You know, I feel for the people of Afghanistan. They have suffered enough, and – 
Najafizada: Thank you for that. 
Qureshi: And, the second country that has suffered after you is us. We’ve lost 83,000 lives on a counterterrorism. We’ve had our economy suffered. 
Najafizada: If you allow me, Mr. Foreign Minister. Are you against a Taliban military takeover? 
Qureshi: We have never said, we have never supporter or advocated a takeover of Kabul by force. No. 
Najafizada: You’re against it? 
Qureshi: Absolutely. 
Najafizada: Are you against a return of an Islamic emirate? 
Qureshi: See, what I have said is it is for you, the people of Afghanistan, to decide what you want. 
Najafizada:  Even if it is an Islamic emirate. 
Qureshi: How can I speak for you? How can I speak for you? What we have said is – 
Najafizada: You object it, or you don’t object it? 
Qureshi: Can I tell you what we’ve said? We want to see an independent, sovereign, prosperous, democratic Afghanistan. What does that mean? 
Najafizada: No emirate. Democracy?
Qureshi: What does that mean? What does that mean? You can do your own interpretation. I’ve said what you want.
Najafizada:  Why can’t you explain that? 
Qureshi: I’ve explained enough for people to understand what I’m saying. 
Najafizada: We talked about President Ghani and you mentioned civil war. Does that concern you that Afghanistan is heading to civil war?
Qureshi: Obviously! 
Najafizada:  Are we? 
Qureshi: I hope not. I hope not. Please, that’s why I’m saying, please sit together and carve out a way forward, you know, which is coexistence, reconciliation. Accept each other. You have to accept each other. You know, the people and government in Afghanistan and the Taliban that have been fighting for decades now, they’re both Afghans. You have to reconcile, and you have to find a way forward. We’re concerned because God forbid, if there is civil war. 
Najafizada: You see signs of it? Are we going in that direction?
Qureshi: I hope not. I hope not. 
Najafizada: But that’s hope, right? What’s your – 
Qureshi: It depends on you, depends on the Afghan leadership, depends on the ability of the Afghan leadership to carve a way forward. If you fail, if the Afghan leadership fail, then yes, we are heading for a civil war. And God forbid, if there is one, then you suffer and we suffer as well. We fear another influx of refugees. We’re already supporting close to 3 million refugees that the in    ternational community has forgotten about, but we’re supporting them. We’ve opened our hearts and minds for them. We’ve been as hospitable as we could in the given resources that we have. Right? By giving them education, by giving them scholarships, by giving you medical treatments, by allowing trade. Even in COVID conditions, we opened the Torkham border 24/7 for that to facilitate human traffic movement and your trades and goods. You now, we’ve done everything possible. 
Najafizada: It’s mutual, right? 
Qureshi: Absolutely. See, everything, bilateral relationships are mutual. Both sides have to see a benefit in it and we do see. We see benefit in good relations with Afghanistan. 
Najafizada: Lets come back to the question of the Taliban and put a step back. Who are the Taliban? Madrassa students, insurgency, terrorist group? How would you define them?
Qureshi: They’re Afghans who have – 
Najafizada: Who have guns and kill people.
  Qureshi: Well, killing has taken place from both sides unfortunately.
Najafizada: Who are the Taliban? You have a definition?
Qureshi: The Afghans. 
Najafizada: That’s it? 
Qureshi: They’re Afghans. Aren’t they? Are you saying they’re not Afghans?
Najafizada: The Taliban are Afghans.
Qureshi: Yes, that’s what I’m saying. 
Najafizada: But then you have Afghans who are terrorists, Afghans who are not terrorists, you have good Afghans, bad Afghans, like good Pakistanis, bad Pakistanis. 
Qureshi: Depends who’s looking at things how? At times, people are dubbed as terrorists, at times people are seen and viewed and they proclaimed to be an element fighting for an occupation, wanting freedom of their land. So depends how you look at it. 
Najafizada: You’re foreign minister of a very important country, particularly when it comes to Afghanistan. So your views matter and your policies matter. So that’s why I ask again for the last time, how would you characterize the Taliban?
Qureshi: Afghans.
Najafizada: Are they funded here in Pakistan? 
Qureshi: These are very those many things that have been going on for years. You’re stuck in the old groove. Get of out that groove, please. Get out of that groove. Now, listen, if you remain stuck in this, believe me you will not be able to travel far. And we want you to travel far. We want reconciliation and peace. 
Najafizada: Are you scared of the Taliban as Pakistan? 
Qureshi: Scared? 
Najafizada: No?
Qureshi: Why should we be scared of Taliban?
Najafizada: They can be a threat to Pakistan. 
Qureshi: Not at all. 
Najafizada: Their relationship with the Pakistani Taliban.
Qureshi: You see, the TTP (Tehreek Taliban-e-Pakistan) has been undertaken terrorist activities, using Afghan soil against Pakistan. And we’re concerned about that. And, we have spoken to the Afghan authorities and we feel they need to me monitored and they need to be checked. When you say no safe havens, we say no safe havens on both sides. 
Najafizada: Right, let’s start with this side. Quetta and Peshawar Shuras, when you hear these terms, how do you feel?
Qureshi: I’ve been hearing of these terms for now decades. Move on. Move on. 
Najafizada: They don’t exist? 
Qureshi: Sorry? 
Najafizada: Taliban, Quetta Shura, doesn’t exist? 
Qureshi: I think the Taliban Shura is sitting right there in Afghanistan. Go look for it. 
Najafizada: Of course. They control territory.
Qureshi: Go look for it. 
Najafizada: The question is whether they’re in Quetta or not.
Qureshi: I said that earlier that in our assessment, see, we’ve had a porous border for years. Now we’re in the process of fencing that border. Right? Why are we doing that? For better border management. It is important. If we have to check terrorism, then we have to manage our border, we have to regulate our border, Afghanistan-Pakistan border. 
Najafizada: Which is an important topic. I will come to that. 
Qureshi. Let me finish. Now, we’re doing what we can on our part. What we’re saying is there are million Afghans still living in Pakistan. They want to go home and we want them to go home in an honorable, dignified manner. Once they’ve gone back, and then there is cross border movement, we can be held more responsible for that. If there are thousands of people coming in –
Najafizada: They go home, they fight, they come back, get treated, then they go back. 
Qureshi: If there are thousands of people crossing the border for trade, for treatment. 
Najafizada: You have fenced the border. 
Qureshi: I said we’re in the process of fencing the border. 
Najafizada: More than 80 to 90 percent is completed. 
Qureshi: Yes, we have. And there has been a check. Terrorism gone down, it has gone down. You know, we have our areas at a very big cost, we paid a huge price. We have cleansed areas and amalgamated them into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. That’s a huge development. A democracy has been introduced there. Elections have taken place there. They have been given, they have representation in the National Assembly and they’ve also been given representation in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa elected assembly. 
Najafizada: Your prime minister – 
Qureshi: Funds have been pumped in. Development activities going on. Life is returning to normalcy over there. Cricket matches taking place over there. Bazars are functioning over there. So we made an effort for that. 
Najafizada: You had a military campaign to go after Pakistani Taliban.
Qureshi: It was not just a military campaign, it was a military campaign plus political engagement, plus addressing their needs, plus undertaking development activity, plus in-cooperating them, amalgamating them into mainstream. It is a multi-pronged approach. 
Najafizada: Your prime minister, Mr. Imran Khan, said that “the ISI trained the Taliban as well as al-Qaeda.” This was before he comes to office. You disagree?
Qureshi: See, the international world and the international community along with the United States trained freedom fighters when they were fighting the Soviet Union. 
Najafizada: The Taliban did not exist. 
Qureshi: And when the Soviets left, the Americans pulled out without a comprehensive plan and then different people did different things. 
Najafizada: You recognized the Taliban regime in the 90s as one of the three countries.
Qureshi: Yes, we did.  
Najafizada: Was it the right move? Was it the good thing to do it? 
Qureshi: As I said, we have to work with anyone who is governing the country. They were in charge of Kabul and we had bilateral trade issues with them, we had other issues with them, so we had to engage with someone. They were in charge. So, if today, President Ashraf Ghani is in charge, we engage with him. We’ve been to Kabul. 
Najafizada: The Taliban were shooting women in the stadium, they were banning television, and they were stopping girls from going to school. 
Qureshi: Well, we have never advocated that. I will never advocate that. You come to Pakistan, you’re in Pakistan. Go around and see, there’re women who are in parliament, there’re women who are in civil service, there’re women who are judges. 
Najafizada: We want the same. 
Qureshi: We want you to have the same. There’s no objection to that. It’s for you to decide. What we’re saying is we’re an Islamic country like you. Right? We dress similarly, we more or less eat the same kind of cuisine, speak the same language. 
Najafizada: Masala is a bit different. 
Qureshi: Yeah, perhaps, it is a bit different, but we’ll make it less spicy when you come, right? We will make it spicy according to your taste, but you see our life, you see our institutions functioning, you see girls going to school. Now, if we’re doing it in our country – 
Najafizada: But the Taliban are not allowing this. 
Qureshi: Listen. If we’re doing it in our country, right? Would we be advocating something else over there? No. No. 
Najafizada: But the Taliban that a lot of Afghans believe as well international community they have roots here, they have bases here, they have Shuras here, are not allowing it. So my question is where is Mullah Hibatullah? Do you know? 
Qureshi: Ask the in charge of NDS. 
Najafizada: Does he know?
Qureshi: Perhaps. Ask him. 
Najafizada: They say he is in Pakistan. 
Qureshi: What we know is that there are people in Afghanistan who have been attacking my country. There are outside forces who are using their presence in Afghanistan to undermine Pakistan. 
Najafizada: India? 
Qureshi: Well, who are undermining Pakistan, who are carrying out subversive activities in Baluchistan. 
Najafizada: I will come to that. That’s important. 
Qureshi: And, they are there. And they are funding and they are training and they are doing everything possible, but we’re not allying that to come between us. Despite all that, we want Afghanistan to be peaceful, stable and prosperous. 
Najafizada: Hibatullah is not in Pakistan. 
Qureshi: Ask your government about that. 
Najafizada: Siraj Haqqani? 
Qureshi: Ask your government. 
Najafizada: Mullah Yaqub? 
Qureshi: Carry on. Keep naming them. 
Najafizada: Shaikh Hakim came here last month for consultation with their leaders to Pakistan. They said it publicly. 
Qureshi: They didn’t contact me, so I wouldn’t know. 
Najafizada: So at least you are not their leader. Maybe they did come. 
Qureshi: I am an elected representative of Pakistan.
Najafizada: Are you in the recent visits of Pakistani officials including Gen. Bajwa to Kabul there were discussions about meeting between Afghan leaders, pan Afghan leaders, and the Taliban here. Any progress on that? 
Qureshi: Well, we’ve welcomed all Afghan leaders to Pakistan. Some have come and some will come and we will receive them warmly and sit with them, talk with them, hear them out, but I think engaging with the Taliban leadership, perhaps Pakistan is the best place. There has to be a – why don’t you engage with them, well you’re already engaging with them. 
Najafizada: In Doha? 
Qureshi: The best place perhaps could be Doha. 
Najafizada: Why not Pakistan? 
Qureshi: Why not Pakistan, because they are not in Pakistan. The bulk is not in Pakistan. 
Najafizada: Well, it can be in Afghanistan then. 
Qureshi: In Afghanistan? That’s for your government to decide. I mean if they’re in Afghanistan, you decide where do you want to meet. 
Najafizada: Prime Minister Imran Khan called Osama bin Laden a martyr. 
Qureshi: Well, again – 
Najafizada: Simple statement. 
Qureshi: Out of context. He was quoted out of context. And, a particular section of the media pair it up. 
Najafizada: Is he a martyr? You disagree? Osama bin Laden?
Qureshi: I will let that pass. 
Najafizada: Let’s come back to the Indian influence in Afghanistan. You somehow refer to it. How many Indian consulates are in Afghanistan? 
Qureshi: Well, on paper, perhaps four. 
Najafizada: Unofficially?
Qureshi: You would know better.
Najafizada: You doubt it? You doubt what’s on paper?
Qureshi: No, I’m saying, we feel that, at times we feel that, you know, you don’t share a border with India. Obviously, you have sovereign relations and you have bilateral relation and you have every right to have sovereign and bilateral relations with India. You trade with India, they come and carry out development work there. That’s fine, that’s completely fine with us. But at times we feel that their presence is perhaps larger than it ought to be because they don’t share a border with you.
Najafizada: Does it bother you that they have?
Qureshi: If they used your soil against us, it bothers me.
Najafizada: Are they?
Qureshi: Yes, they are.
Najafizada: How?
Qureshi: How? By carrying out terrorist activities. You know, we have intelligence, we have information, we have shared that, and you know, we have very famous person who is admitted to carrying out subversive activities, terrorist activities, in Pakistan, in Baluchistan.
Najafizada: One would also raise the issue of Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish Mohammed, are they Pakistan-based terrorist groups?
Qureshi: Well, frankly our government is very clear. We are supporting no terrorist group. We are support no terrorist group. Even with India when we – 
Najafizada: Maybe you don’t recognize them as terrorists.
Qureshi: Well, don’t put words into my mouth, I can speak for myself. But with India, we wanted reconciliation and the minute Prime Minster Imran Khan came into office, he said you take one step towards peace we will take two. Unfortunately, they did not reciprocate. Unfortunately, they took steps and measures that vitiated the climate. Despite that, despite that we think that the situation in occupied Jammu and Kashmir is a political situation, it is being mishandled. India today with the measures of 5th of August 2019 has alienated the Kashmiris further, they have not helped themselves and today the situation over there is very delicate and simmering.
Najafizada: Lets come back to our issues. Durand Line. Is that a recognized border?
Qureshi: Well, I think if we want to move ahead and sort of coexist as good neighbors that we desire then I think let’s accept the international border.
Najafizada: Is that an issue that you have discussed it with the Afghan authorities?
Qureshi: Well, in my mind, whether they want to accept it or not for domestic political reasons, the border that exists, in my mind, that’s the international border. 
Najafizada: Is that even a discussion between the government of Pakistan and the government of Afghanistan?
Qureshi: I think I felt no need for that discussion, because, you know, it is accepted and recognized as international border.
Najafizada: So, you are not even interested in talking about it, right?
Qureshi: I don’t feel the need.
Najafizada: Let’s come back to some of the internal issues here. Is PTM, Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement, posing risk to Pakistan’s stability?
Qureshi: Well, they have presence in the national assembly.
Najafizada: They get arrested.
Qureshi: Well, anybody can get arrested if you break the law, you can get arrested.
Najafizada: Minus the Taliban leaders?
Qureshi: Sorry? 
Najafizada: Minus the Taliban leaders.
Qureshi: Well, I would not respond to that. I can, but I will not because I, unlike your National Security Adviser, will not like to vitiate the climate between Pakistan and Afghanistan at this critical moment where we’re advocating peace and reconciliation. I can say a lot more than I have said, but that is not the objective, the objective is to move on, the objective is not to remain stuck in the past and I feel at times many in Afghanistan are stuck in the past.
Najafizada: Let’s move on, come back to PTM. Their leaders getting arrested, Ali Wazir, Manzoor Pashteen, Mohsen Dawar.
Qureshi: Mohsen Dawar is not arrested, he was sitting with me yesterday, we were in parliament yesterday, we had a good chat yesterday, we were talking about, you know, some good parliamentary issue.
Najafizada: He has been arrested before, right?
Qureshi: Well, I have said if you don’t break the law, if I break the law, I can get arrested.
Najafizada: And what does it say about Pakistan or even Afghanistan, democracy, and respect for human rights and press freedom and freedom of expression?
Qureshi: In Pakistan?
Najafizada: Yes, the recent arrests and the fact that they are.
Qureshi: Believe me, believe in me, you go around in Pakistan, you look at the newspapers, you look at the television channels, you are here in Islamabad, you know, sit and watch a few talk shows and you will see how independent our press is? The press in Pakistan is completely independent. And, we, as democrats, do not believe in gagging the press because today you cannot, even if you want to, with the new tools available, with social media, now you can’t, you cannot hide things under the carpet. We recognize and accept that so we would never gag the press.
Najafizada: So, what laws have the leaders of PTM breached?
Q: Well, if there is attack on a post, right? Then that’s is breach of some law.
Najafizada: Is radicalism, Mr. Foreign Minister, a challenge to Pakistan?
Qureshi: It’s a challenge to the globe. Unfortunately, the level of tolerance all over has gone down, the level of intolerance has gone up. Extremism and radicalism has been on the rise everywhere, not in Pakistan, everywhere. Look what happened the other day in Canada. Five innocent Canadian Pakistanis were mowed down. Why? For what fault of theirs? I must admire and respect Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He has recognized it. He recognized it as an Islamophobic attack and terrorism
Najafizada: How do you address radicalism here as a nation as a country?
Qureshi: Well, I personally feel that the overwhelming majority of people in Pakistan are moderates. They are not extremists. They are law abiding, they want peace, you know, they want an improvement in standard of living. They want to support their families and go about normal life.
Najafizada: And what is your vision for Pakistan’s identity in the global stage?
Najafizada: Well, the vision of Pakistan was set by founder Qayed-e-Azam Muhammad    Ali Jannah, the values that he advocated. My party, the party of Prime Minister Imran Khan, believes in his vision and his values.
Najafizada: Which are?
Qureshi: Which are Islamic, democratic, welfare state.
Najafizada: Let’s talk about Islam and Muslims in particular. The Muslims in China, are oppressed ones. Can politics allow you to comment on that publicly?
Qureshi: Well, do you have to comment on everything publicly? Do you have to?
Najafizada: If you believe in values and – 
Q: If you believe in values, you have a different relationship with different countries. And with friends, you adopt a different approach. China is a friend and we’ve recognized China as a friend and China standing by Pakistan through thick and thin.
Najafizada: As closing, Mr. Foreign Minister, how history should judge those who bombed the Bamiyan Buddhas?
Qureshi: Well, I am someone who believes in faith harmony. In Islam, there is room for minorities, people who sort of think differently, practice a different religion, you know, we should respect that. In Pakistan, you can see there are temples, there are Gurdwaras, and there are churches along with mosques, functioning. Minorities over here are going about their lives as ordinary Pakistanis.
Najafizada: How history should judge those who bombed the Buddhas of Bamiyan?
Qureshi: We should respect sites, symbols of all religions.
Najafizada: How history should judge those who hanged and executed President Najibullah?
Qureshi: Anyone killing an innocent person cannot be justified. Human lives are important. Every human life is important and that is one of the teachings of Islam in any civilized society.
Najafizada: Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Quraishi of Pakistan, Thank you for your time.
Qureshi: Thank you.

If Taliban 'Wants Enmity', Will Face 'Serious Response’: Ghani
","
The Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Saturday warned that “if the Taliban want enmity than they will face a serious response.” 
While introducing the new ministerial nominees for the Ministries of Defense and Interior, President Ghani said the Taliban should decide in what way they want to proceed: by seeking a political solution or continuing ""enmity."" 
“The Taliban must choose: do you want to be in the future based on a lasting and just peace based on a political solution with dignity or do you want enmity, to which this nation will give a strong response? No one should doubt this,” he said.
President Ghani criticized the recent Taliban attacks on various parts of the country--and the targeting of civilians.
Addressing the Taliban, he said: ""Why are you targeting public facilities, bridges and small bridges? Why are you placing roadside mines that kill women and children?” 
""Why are you burning schools and the district governor office? Isn't the answer as clear as the sun? Do you work for others?” he mentioned. 
Meanwhile, he said that the new changes in the Ministries of National Defense and Interior are intended to strengthen the security institutions. 
""We all know that martyrdom on the way to the homeland is an honor, but we want life, not death for a country that is deprived of it's most basic right, which is peace.
""There is a clear need for a national, regional and international dialogue to be implemented across the country, the region and the world to say: “Is 43 years (of war) not enough?” he said. 
""Here we must conclude that we will not surrender to the terrorists, we will not surrender to the grim plans, we are the future-makers, we are shaping the future,"" he added. 
Doubts over the Taliban’s intentions for a political settlement 
Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, said that he has grave concerns that the Taliban will not show any flexibility for a political agreement with the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan once the US troops leave the country. 
Abdullah said there are clear indications that the Taliban are trying to advance militarily before the withdrawal of foreign forces from the country. 
“The point is that it will have an implication, an impact on the negotiations with the Taliban. The Taliban may find themselves further emboldened and they may think, some of them at least, that with the withdrawal they can take advantage of the situation militarily, so why to get seriously into the negotiations?"" said Abdullah in an interview with AP. 
Abdullah however warned the Taliban not to miscalculate the situation, saying that no one will be able to win militarily. 
“It will be a big miscalculation on part of the Taliban should they think that they can win militarily, and I repeat that there are no winners through the continuation of the war,” he added in the interview.

MoFA: Islamabad Has Leverage to Push Taliban to Peace Talks
","
In reaction to remarks by Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) on Sunday said that Islamabad has effective tools to “encourage Taliban leaders to start meaningful peace negotiations.”
In an interview with TOLOnews aired on Saturday, Qureshi said Taliban leadership “lives in Afghanistan” and that the leaders of the group are visiting Pakistan “for facilitating the peace process.”
But the Afghan Foreign Ministry said that such remarks that affect bilateral ties and progress in the peace process should be avoided.
The ministry said there is a need for Pakistan’s sincere cooperation and the implementation of its commitments to Afghanistan to achieve peace in the country.
Qureshi in his interview said Pakistan is unfairly blamed for problems in Afghanistan.
“Pakistan is not responsible for the failure within. Pakistan is not responsible for the squabbling that is going on in Afghanistan. Pakistan is not responsible if the Afghan leadership cannot sit and work out a peace deal. We’re not responsible for that. It’s yours,” he said.
Foreign Minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar at an event titled “Terrorism Threat Transforming” held by the Antalya Democracy Forum in Turkey on Sunday said Afghanistan can make peace with the Taliban but they should stop the “insurgency.”
“We can make peace with the Taliban because they are Afghans, but they have to stop terrorism, they have to stop killing people and they have to stop cooperating with international terrorists. However, we cannot make peace with al Qaeda, Daesh and other terrorist groups who are not Afghans. We have no political reason to work with them. Our only goal is for them to leave our country,” said Atmar.
Qureshi’s remarks on Pakistan’s ties with the Taliban sparked reactions in both Afghanistan and Pakistan.
“Qureshi was defending the Taliban in a way as if he was the Taliban’s foreign minister, not Pakistan’s,” said Pakistani lawmaker Mohsin Dawar who is also a member of Pashtun Tahafuz Movement, referring to Qureshi’s interview with TOLOnews.
On Twitter, Dawar said: “He (Qureshi) appears to have been tasked to do this by those who control his government and the Taliban. Those who support the Taliban cannot claim to be working for peace.”
“It is a shameful remark in indeed, and it is like seeing the sun but saying it does not exist. It is clear like the sun that the Taliban’s centers are in Pakistan, and they are their strongest supporter,” said Mursal Nabizada, an MP from Kabul. 
Qureshi said in the interview that Afghanistan should accept the Durand Line as an international border as a ""good neighbor,"" but Afghan leaders took issue with his comment. 
“There should be patience in regard to important national issues like borders--the problems we have with our neighbors, not only with Pakistan but other neighbors,” Hizb-e-Islami leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar said. 
Qureshi warned that Afghanistan will move towards a civil war if the situation is not managed by the Afghan leadership.

Afghan, Turkish, Iranian Ministers Agree to Enhance Cooperation
","
Foreign ministers of Afghanistan, Turkey and Iran in a trilateral meeting in Antalya reaffirmed a commitment to “solidarity and cooperation” based on “deep-rooted historical, religious and cultural commonalities and shared values,” the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
Mohammad Haneef Atmar, Javad Zarif and Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu held the meeting on the sidelines of the Antalya Diplomacy Forum.
They underlined their commitment to further expand cooperation particularly in the areas that would contribute to economic progress and sustainable development.
The three foreign ministers expressed their ""willingness to enhance their cooperation on regional connectivity in the fields of transport, trade, energy and infrastructure,"" and agreed to sign a Memorandum of Understanding.
They also underlined the ""importance of further strengthening cooperation in the fight against terrorism and violent extremism in all their forms and manifestations, transnational organized crime and illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and their precursors, and arms, human trafficking, crimes against cultural and historical heritage, cybercrimes and illegal migration,"" the ministry statement said.
They expressed their determination to increase cooperation in ""people-to-people contacts, education, social and cultural exchange and tourism.""
The ministers recognized the importance of the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process (HoA-IP) as a substantial platform that contributes to regional stability in fields ranging from political and security cooperation to economic integration.
They acknowledged the role of the regional and neighboring countries, in particular the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan, in hosting Afghan refugees and called for creating ""conducive conditions in Afghanistan for their voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable repatriation.""
The ministers also agreed to enhance cooperation in the field of migration and urged the international community to increase technical and financial assistance to host countries in taking care of the essential needs of Afghan refugees and to provide support to the repatriation and reintegration efforts of the Government of Afghanistan.
They vowed their commitment to support a sovereign, independent, democratic and unified Afghanistan.
The ministers ""deplored the continuing high level of violence in Afghanistan and particularly condemned attacks targeting civilians and reiterated that a sustainable peace can be achieved only through an inclusive Afghan-led and Afghan-owned political process that aims a permanent and nationwide ceasefire as well as an inclusive political settlement,"" the statement said.
They announced their ongoing support for the Afghan Peace Negotiations for the achievement of a just and durable political settlement.
The ministers recognized the efforts of Turkey together with Qatar and the UN to hold a high-level meeting in Istanbul aimed at giving momentum to the ongoing Afghan Peace Negotiations and called on the Taliban to fulfill their commitment for ending violence, establishing immediate and permanent ceasefire and achieving an inclusive negotiated settlement leading to lasting peace in Afghanistan desired by the Afghan people, the region and the international community.

Taliban Deputy Leader Baradar Calls for Doha Deal Implementation
","
Taliban deputy leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar said that to achieve progress in the peace negotiations there is a need for the implementation of the Doha agreement. His statement comes amid ramped-up fighting across the country and the fall of dozens of districts to the Taliban.
Baradar, in an article published Sunday on the group's website, stressed the importance of protecting citizens' rights based on the teachings of Islam. He wrote that the group wants the establishment of a “real Islamic system” in Afghanistan. 
Baradar, who also heads the Taliban’s office in Doha, said that the release of the remaining prisoners and the removal of Taliban leaders from the UN blacklist are important for progress in the peace negotiations. 
“A real Islamic system is the best tool for solving all the problems faced by Afghans,” Baradar writes, “And it is the only demand for which all layers of Afghan society are united and do not oppose.”
He said that Afghans want “a powerful Islamic system to protect Afghanistan from invasion and the interference of foreigners and also to assure the world of peace in Afghanistan.”
He faintly referenced women’s rights, saying the group sees itself as committed to the rights of all Afghans--men and women--under Islamic teachings in light of desirable Afghan traditions. 
But Hizb-e-Islami leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar in an interview with TOLOnews on Sunday said that the Taliban so far has no clear definition of an Islamic system and has not clarified whether they will accept an election under a future government. 
“So far, unfortunately, The Taliban has failed to have a clear definition and interpretation about a future government in which the details of the system, the leader and the role of the people are specified,” Hekmatyar said.
The Presidential Palace, meanwhile, called the Taliban remarks a trick.
“They are not sincere in their remarks. They only want to deceive the people of Afghanistan,” a presidential spokesman Mohammad Amiri said. 
Meanwhile, Hekmatyar in an opinion piece--a copy of which was sent to TOLOnews--blamed the Afghan government and the Taliban for the lack of a plan in the Doha negotiations. He said that success from the Doha agreement will not be possible.
“The details of the Doha talks, in terms of the formation of the delegation and its venue, should change. The talks should change to another place,” Hekmatyar said.
The Doha negotiations are currently locked in a stalemate while fighting is reported in 24 provinces in the last 24 hours.

Lawmakers: Unity, Not Reshuffling Posts, Will Overcome Crisis
","
Lawmakers and military experts said there is an urgent need for a unified perspective on both the war and the peace process among politicians within and outside the government to overcome the current crisis, adding that otherwise, reshuffling posts of security institutions will not prove effective. 
Lawmakers said the management of the war is key and suggested that the government needs to review its plans for the war. 
In just two days, President Ghani appointed new acting ministers for the defense and interior affairs ministries and four deputy ministers for the ministry of interior affairs.  
Abdul Rahman Rahman was appointed as senior deputy minister of interior for security, Wahidullah Kalimzai as deputy minister of interior for counter-narcotics, Mohammad Farid Afzali as deputy minister of interior for training, and ex-Faryab governor Naqibullah Fayiq as the deputy minister of interior for policy and strategy. 
“Individuals’ abilities and capacity should be used for security without considering who belongs to what ethnic group or political party,” said Mohammad Alam Ezedyar, the deputy speaker of the Afghan senate. 
“The changes should strengthen the security structure in this critical situation,” said Arif Rahmani, an MP from Ghazni. 
“One person is appointed one day and another the other day. This itself deteriorates the situation,” said Mohammadajan Mangal, a Senator. 
Others believe that coordination among Afghan forces should be boosted to overcome the deteriorating situation. 
“They should better protect remaining districts that are contested or where soldiers are under siege,” said Khadija Ilham, an MP from Kapisa. 
But President Ghani and security chiefs have pledged that the changes in the leadership of the security and defense agencies will address the current crisis. 
“We can overcome all the problems that have been imposed on us,” President Ghani said on Saturday. 
“I am starting my job by using my experience from the resistance time and recent serving in the security and defense forces,” Acting Defense Minister Gen. Bismillah Mohammadi said. 
Ghani in a speech on Saturday warned that “if the Taliban want enmity than they will face a serious response.”

Clashes Reach Gates of Faryab's Capital in Northern Afghanistan
","
With the centers of many districts in Faryab now under Taliban control, clashes have begun in the city of Maimana in the northern province, increasing the alarm of Faryab residents and lawmakers from the province in Kabul, who say that urgent action by the security forces is needed.
 Along with fighting in the center of Faryab, the centers of 11 districts have fallen to the Taliban over the last 24 hours. The districts include Chal, Namak Ab, Yangi Qala, Khwaja Ghar and Hazar Samooch districts in Takhar, the Dara-e-Soof-e-Bala district in Samangan, Chahar Bolak district in Balkh, Khashrod District in Nimroz, Manjigak and Khanaqah districts in Jawzjan and Kharwar district in Logar. 
Faryab lawmakers said the province needs urgent attention to push back the Taliban attacks from the center of Faryab. 
The newly appointed acting defense minister Gen. Bismillah Mohammadi called on the people to stand with security forces and that the government will provide facilities and equipment. 
The city of Maimana looked empty on Sunday morning following intensified clashes that inched closer to the center of the northern town.  
“The people have been dispersed everywhere. Those who could have fled to villages,” said Darwish, a Faryab resident. 
“The conflict has reached the gates and the outskirts of the city. The Taliban has reached the gates of the city,” said Mirwais, a Faryab resident. 
Faryab residents warned that the city will fall to the Taliban if action is not taken to push back the militants. 
“The government and the security and defense forces should take urgent action to save the Maimana city residents from this situation because it is on the verge of collapse,” said Shafiqa Sakha Yulchi, an MP from Farah. 
The situation has been fragile in the northeastern province of Takhar over the last two weeks. Eight districts of the province, including Chal, Baharak, Ishkamish, Namak Ab, Yangi Qala, Khwaja Ghar and Hazar Samooch, have either fallen to the Taliban or have been evacuated by security forces within a week's time.
“The war management is weak because they are not keeping one commander two months in one assignment. They are deployed from one place to another and from that place to still another. All the time passes during these reshuffles,” said Amir Mohammad Khaksar, an MP from Takhar. 
Sar-e-Pul, Takhar and Faryab provinces in the north, Ghazni province in the center and Farah province in the west have lost the most territory to the Taliban over the last two months.
“If the Taliban chooses violence, continues fighting and bloodshed, they should realize that they will not achieve their evil end and will take it to the grave,” said Bismillah Mohammadi, the acting defense minister.
Meanwhile, a government forces supply convoy was attacked by the Taliban on the Kabul-Gardez highway in Logar province, causing many vehicles to be damaged, according to local sources.

Foreign Forces Failed at Fighting Extremism: Karzai
","
Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai in an interview with AP on Sunday said that the US came to Afghanistan to fight extremism and bring stability and is leaving nearly 20 years later having failed at both. 
“The international community came here 20 years ago with this clear objective of fighting extremism and bringing stability ... but extremism is at the highest point today. So, they have failed,” he told AP. 
Their legacy is a war-ravaged nation in “total disgrace and disaster,” he said. 
“We recognize as Afghans all our failures, but what about the bigger forces and powers who came here for exactly that purpose? Where are they leaving us now?” he asked and answered: “In total disgrace and disaster.” 
His remarks come as the US President Joe Biden has announced on April 14 that the American troops will leave Afghanistan by September 11.
“We will be better off without their military presence,” Karzai continue. “I think we should defend our own country and look after our own lives. ... Their presence (has given us) what we have now. ... We don’t want to continue with this misery and indignity that we are facing. It is better for Afghanistan that they leave.”

‘Delay in Reinforcements Major Reason Behind Fall of Districts’
","
Military experts and sources have reported that delays in deploying reinforcements to districts – most of which are in rural areas – have been a major cause behind the fall of district centers to the Taliban in the last two months.
Sources in some provinces said that the exaggeration by the Taliban about the number of their fighters and about the expansion of their attacks on other districts is another reason behind the evacuation of districts without any resistance.
On Monday sources said that at least a dozen districts fell to the Taliban. In the past 48 hours, the centers of five districts fell to the group. In many cases, the security forces did not receive reinforcements and evacuated after hours of fighting, locals and other sources said. The districts include Sholgara, Dawlat Abad and Kushinda in Balkh province.
“Many areas are falling to the armed opposition because security forces remain under siege and they have no equipment or supplies,” said Raihana Sadat, a member of the provincial council in Balkh.
On Sunday, at least 600 security force members in Dasht-e-Archi district in Kunduz retreated to Khawaja Bahauddin District in Takhar, according to sources. Later during the same day, Qala-e-Zal district in Kunduz was also evacuated by security forces.
“The Imam Sahib district will also fall if the situation continues,” said Khaluddin Hakimi, a member of the Kunduz provincial council.
In Faryab, meanwhile, in addition to the fall of six districts to the Taliban, fighting has inched closer to the capital, Maimana. MPs from the province said the lack of reinforcements has led to the crisis in the province.
However, the Defense Ministry on Monday said that reinforcements have been sent to Maimana.
“It is questionable,” said Sayed Anwar Rasul Oghli, head of a youth movement in Kabul. “People know that the security forces stationed in Qaisar, Dawlat Abad, Shirin Tagab and Khwaja Sabz Posh (districts) retreated without any resistance.”
“We had at least 300 people. Many of them fought and said they were faced with an offensive attack. They did not know the number (of the Taliban), but it was exaggerated, and they were told that at least 5,000 to 6,000 Taliban were attacking them,” said Fawzia Raufi, an MP from Faryab.
The Defense Ministry also said that all options are on the table to improve the security situation.
“You witnessed the clearance of many areas in Takhar last night,” Defense Ministry spokesman Rohullah Ahmdzai said.
“I am ready. It is not only Qaisar (district)… I am ready to go to Faryab, to Jawzjan, or any other place that has fallen, even areas that are too challenging. I am ready to go and respond to the Talibs,” said Nizamuddin Qaisari, former police chief for Qaisar district in Faryab.
Figures collected by TOLOnews show that at least 50 districts have fallen to the Taliban or have been evacuated in the last two months. Many of these districts are still contested and have seen ongoing fighting over the last few weeks.

MPs Seek Formation of Public Front to Fight Taliban
","
The new wave of violence engulfing the country--now especially in the north--compelled some lawmakers on Monday to call for the formation of a ""high council of combat"" led by various prominent leaders from around the country as well as politicians in order to fight the Taliban.
The lawmakers said the government has lost control of managing the war and to defend the country the government should mobilize influential mujahideen leaders and public uprising forces.
The speaker of Parliament and some lawmakers emphasized the importance of a national consensus under the current situation and said the government should consider the value and participation of all ethnic groups when it comes to appointments in security agencies.
“There were forces, there were arms, and there was morale, but the morale was killed, unfortunately,” said Fazl Karim Aimaq, an MP from Kunduz.
“The government should be asked why districts have been handed over without resistance,” said Belqis Roshan, an MP from Farah.
“The government has unfair views toward the people and regions. Another reason (behind the fall of the districts) is the removal of experienced figures from the system,” said Habiba Danesh, an MP from Takhar.
The legislators stressed the need for a national mobilization against the Taliban.
“The Taliban offensive, the launch of a psychological war and the complication of the internal crisis have made us deeply concerned,” said Mir Rahman Rahmani, the parliament speaker.
“Six districts belonged to the first regiment. The commander is not there,” said Razi Mangal, an MP from Paktia.
“Our shallow leaders should manage the war, they are outside the country as the people are killed,” said Sadiq Qaderi an MP from Herat.
According to MPs, the support of neighboring countries for the Taliban is one of the reasons behind an escalation of violence in the country.
“There are countries that want to cause Afghanistan’s system to collapse so they can divide it into different countries and merge it with their own country,” said Shinkai Karokhil, an MP from Kabul.
“Pakistan wants to keep the war here fueled and wants to continue this proxy war,” said Nasir Farahi, an MP from Farah.
The government said that new plans are have been formed to boost security. The reshuffling of positions in the security agencies is said to have been part of this plan.

Citizens in Various Provinces Take Up Arms to Fight Taliban
","
People in various provinces including Takhar, Balkh and Baghlan in the north, Badghis in the west, and Parwan in central Afghanistan, have taken up arms to fight the Taliban amid an escalation of violence by the group. 
Public uprising forces commanders in the provinces said they will stand beside the security forces to retake the lost districts. Some politicians said that it is necessary that people have taken up arms to defend the country under the current circumstances. 
In Takhar, the Taliban has attacked at least 10 districts. Now some residents have taken up arms to support the fight against the Taliban in preparation for potential attacks in Namak Ab, Rustaq and Kalafgan districts in the province. 
“The former mujahideen commanders, security forces, the police chief, the security chief, the governor, all were here and deployed people to various areas,” said Gen. Najibullah Najib, a former mujahideen commander. 
“We will never allow the Punjabis, the puppets, to threaten this country,” said Abdul Bashir, the deputy commander of a special forces unit in Takhar. 
Officials in Takhar said that government institutions in Rustaq, Kalafgan, Worsaj, Farkhar and the city of Taluqan have fallen to the Taliban. 
“You see that we are on the frontlines. Mr. Saadat and the commander of the highway is also here,” said Abdul Khalil Zahid, a commander of public uprising forces. 
“We are now in the Chashma-e-Shir frontline (in Takhar). It is not concerning. All Takhar people have been mobilized and are standing with security forces” said Habibullah Mahboob, a Takhar resident. 
Meanwhile, Balkh governor Farhad Azimi said that former mujahideen commanders have been mobilized to fight against the Taliban in the province following the fall of the centers of five districts of Balkh to the group. 
“Thousands of forces have been prepared to defend the city of Mazar-e-Sharif, the outskirts of Mazar-e-Sharif and the districts that have been lost,” Azimi said.  
A former mujahideen commander said that handing over districts to the Taliban is not acceptable and that they are fully ready to support the Afghan forces. 
“The move by Badghis residents is a self-motivated action and the main goal is to defend the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the security forces,” said Abdul Basir Salangi, an MP from Badghis. 
“We fought against the Taliban for years. I assure you that we will prevent the Taliban from recent disturbances in a few days,” said Mohammad Amin Dara-e-Soofi, a former mujahideen commander in Balkh. 
“We have enough special forces members in Jamshidi and Chai Khan area (in Balkh),” the Afghan Army’s recruitment officer Sayed Yasin Sadad said. 
The back-to-back fall of districts to the Taliban in the last two months has been unprecedented. Most of the districts that have fallen to the Taliban have been in the north.

Fighting Reaches Outskirts of Major Cities in North

Fighting has reached five cities in the north as many districts around provincial capitals have fallen to the Taliban in the last few weeks, mostly in Faryab and Takhar provinces. 
Lawmakers and residents warned that fighting around the cities of Maimana in Faryab, Taluqan in Takhar, Pul-e-Khumri in Baghlan, Sar-e-Pul city in Sar-e-Pul and Kunduz city in Kunduz province have raised concerns among the people.  
The main route that connects Kabul with northern provinces has been closed to traffic for the last two days because of Taliban influence in Doshi district in Baghlan. 
The government announced that security forces had retaken two districts in Takhar; however, many districts across the country that are in Taliban control are being reported: Sources said that security forces left the three districts of Sholgara, Dawlat Abad and Kushinda in Balkh; the Qala-e-Zal and Imam Sahib district in Kunduz; Doshi and Julga districts in Baghlan; Aqcha district in Jawzjan; and Zazai Aryub district in the eastern province of Paktia in the last 24 hours. 
“There isn’t anyone to help. The fighting has reached the entrance to Pul-e-Khumri,” said Ajmal, a resident of Pul-e-Khumri. 
“How long will this bloodshed continue?” said Enayat, a Pul-e-Khumri resident. 
A woman, a resident of Balkh, who was on the way to Kabul said she lost her husband who was caught in a crossfire. 
“Suddenly there were clashes. We asked the driver to stop. He didn’t. Glass fell on the people. I lost my father,” said Sahar, a Balkh resident. 
Activists from Faryab who have come to Kabul said that the city of Maimana, the capital of Faryab, is on the verge of collapse and that there is a need for urgent action by the government. 
“Last night, Faryab residents had no place to spend the night. They were displaced. I don’t know why the government does not pay attention to this?” said Frozan Khalilyar, an activist from Faryab. 
Pul-e-Khumri and Taluqan residents meanwhile said security forces are in dire need of reinforcements. 
The fighting has also gripped the northern provinces of Sar-e-Pul and Kunduz. Kunduz temporarily fell to the Taliban back in 2015 and 2016. 
“The situation in Kunduz is deeply concerning. The government officials have no plan to address it,” said Amruddin Wali, a member of the provincial council in Kunduz. 
But the Defense Ministry said that thorough plans are underway to suppress the Taliban. 
“They are fighting the enemy with full force and the security and defense institutions--from the leadership to the soldiers on the battlefield--are making efforts to bring positive changes in those areas,’’ said Rohullah Ahmadzai, a spokesman for the ministry. 
Figures collected by TOLOnews show that at least 60 districts have either fallen to the Taliban or are currently being fought over by government forces and the Taliban.
“They are selling districts and are leaving them. It is not a tactical retreat. It is a deal,” said Abdul Qadir, a Kabul resident.

US Can Provide Over-the-Horizon Support to Afghanistan: Pentagon
","
The US military “can already provide the over-the-horizon support that the Afghan government will need,” Pentagon spokesman John F. Kirby said Monday, adding that the United States leaders continually assess the progress of the retrograde from Afghanistan and the state of operations in the country and adjust accordingly. 
“Those capabilities already exist. Leaders are looking for better ways to perform the missions,” Kirby said. “Other aspects of the Afghan situation are still being studied. Commanders at many levels are wrestling with what over-the-horizon counterinsurgency and over-the-horizon logistics will look like.”  
He said the US leaders continually assess the progress of the retrograde from Afghanistan and the state of operations in the country and adjust accordingly.  
Kirby said that US defense secretary and military leaders in the Pentagon, at US Central Command and in Afghanistan, “are constantly looking at the pace we’re going at, and the capabilities we have, and the capabilities that we're going to need throughout to complete the withdrawal.”  
“So as we said, from the very beginning; while there is a schedule, we are mindful that that schedule could fluctuate and change, as conditions change,” he further said. 
Kirby said there are only two aspects of the Afghanistan retrograde that will not change: “The first is the US military will withdraw all US forces from the country, and the second is the withdrawal will be finished by the September deadline set by President Joe Biden.” 
Austin has extended the aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower in the region. He has deployed a bomber task force to the area.  
“Nobody is discounting how difficult this is,” Kirby said. “But as the secretary said, difficult does not mean impossible, and we have the ability right now to reach any scrap of Earth that we believe we need to, should the risk warrant it.” 
Planners continue to look at ways to provide contractual support to Afghan forces once the retrograde is completed.   
“There's a range of options that we're looking at for how to continue to provide contractual support … specifically the Afghan Air Forces,” Kirby said. “We’re very actively working our way through that right now. We're looking at a range of options.”

At least 50 districts have either fallen to the Taliban or have remained contested between the two sides over the last two months – many of them without resistance by security forces. Sources told TOLOnews that many districts have fallen due to delay in deployment of reinforcements. 
Khan said Pakistan is ready to be a partner for peace in Afghanistan with the United States — but as US troops withdraw, “we will avoid risking further conflict.” 
Similar remarks were made by Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in an interview with TOLOnews last week. He said Pakistan wants to partner with Afghanistan in the peace process. 
“Our countries have the same interest in that long-suffering country,” Khan said. 
“In the past, Pakistan made a mistake by choosing between warring Afghan parties, but we have learned from that experience,” Khan reiterated in the op-ed. 
Back in Kabul, there are doubts among analysts and lawmakers in Pakistan’s approach towards Afghanistan especially when it comes to bringing the Taliban to the table of negotiations.  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Sunday told TOLOnews that Pakistan should use its leverage on Taliban as an essential tool to help the Afghan peace process. 
The ministry said there is a need for Pakistan’s sincere cooperation and the implementation of its commitments to Afghanistan to achieve peace in the country.

New Appointments Meant to Improve Country's Defense: Palace
","
The Presidential Palace said the changes in leadership at the Interior and Defense Ministries are intended to improve the management of the country's defense amid the heavy fighting now taking place across the country.
“For the better management of security and defense affairs, General Besmellah Mohammadi and General Abdul Satar Merzkowal were appointed as Acting Defense Minister and Acting Interior Minister, respectively,” said Mohammad Amiri, a deputy spokesman for the Presidential Palace.
A spokeswoman for the Independent Directorate of Local Governance (IDLG) said that the changes and reforms are based on the political and security situation in the provinces and that changes may also be made in the area of local governance to improve the situation in the provinces.
The IDLG has appointed new governors for Sar-e-Pul, Zabul, and Faryab provinces, and has said the changes will improve the political and security situation in those provinces.
“Any changes made within local governance, generally they are made for the continuation of the republic system, for the improvement of local governance and to provide better services for the people, considering the political, security, and social situation. Changes may come in the future as well,” said a spokeswoman for the Independent Directorate of Local Governance, Narges Momand.
Some members of the Wolesi Jirga, the lower house of Parliament, said the changes and reforms in the security and defense institutions are late and ill-timed, as districts are falling to the Taliban, but there are still hopes that the situation will be managed and it will come under the government's control soon.
“The changes that came should have come a year ago. Until there are changes at the district and provincial levels, I would say to the President that the changes won’t be effective,” said MP Abdul Rauf Shpoon.
Four days ago, President Ashraf Ghani appointed Besmellah Khan Mohammadi as the acting minister of defense, Abdul Satar Mirzkowal as the acting minister of interior, and Hamidullah Tokhi, Abdul Haq Shafaq, and Enayatullah Kamal as governors of Zabul, Sar-e Pol, and Faryab provinces, respectively.

ANDSF Recaptures Three Districts in North as War Intensifies
","
The Afghan government on Tuesday said that the Afghan National Security and Defense Forces (ANDSF) recaptured three strategic districts from the Taliban: Balkh district in Balkh, Dushi district in Baghlan and Ali Abad district in Kunduz.
However, local sources said that over the past 24 hours the Taliban has captured several districts from the ANDSF in the country.
The districts which fell to the Taliban are Gul Tapa, Ali Abad and Chahardara districts in Kunduz, Baghlan-e-Markazi and Nahrain districts in Baghlan, Khamab and Qarqin districts in Jawzjan, Jaghato in Maidan Wardak, Lajmangal and Ahmadkhel in Paktia, Shajoy in Zabul, Maiwand in Kandahar and Choora in Uruzgan.
In the northern part of the country, fighting continues in these provincial capitals: Kunduz city in Kunduz, Maimana in Faryab, Taluqan in Takhar, Pul-e-Khumri in Baghlan and Sar-e-Pul city in Sar-e-Pul.
Local sources said that the war has now reached the outskirts of Kunduz city. They said that the security forces have also withdrawn from the Sher Khan Bandar port area, which borders Tajikistan.
“Currently the war is raging in Sher Khan Bandar, we do have sufficient weaponry in Kunduz,” said Baseera Rasouli, an MP from Kunduz.
“Kunduz is under attack from three or four directions, the situation is distressing, the shops are locked,” said Imamuddin, a resident in Kunduz.
The fighting in Kunduz is displacing people.
“We have been destroyed, there is no way to go to Kabul or other areas,” said Ainuddin, a resident of Kunduz city.
“Special operation units have changed and are in control of the situation, we are now at the frontline,” said Mohammad Ali Yazadani, the commander of Special Operation Corps.
According to reports, fighting is also underway between the ANDSF and the Taliban in suburbs of Pul-e-Khumri city.
“Pul-e-Khumri city will not fall, at any cost. The people should carry on their business and duties with a peaceful mind,” said Safiullah Mazlom, the head of the Baghlan security department.
Fighting was also reported in the city of Maimana in Faryab and Taluqan in Takhar.
“If the central government does not concentrate, we will witness a human tragedy and human catastrophe,” said Lotfullah, a resident in Takhar province.
“Faryab is on the verge of collapse, the people of Faryab are very concerned,” said Darwish, a resident in Faryab.
“If the central government does not take action, we will lose Samkanai, Janikhel and all of Paktia,” said Taj Mohammad Mangal, a member of Paktia's provincial council.
“All problems will be resolved very soon,” said Ajmal Omar Shinwari, a spokesman for the ANDSF.
With the fall of 13 district centers in the past 24 hours, the total number of centers taken by the Taliban in the past two months is 70.

Hundreds of Public Forces Deployed to Guard Mazar-e-Sharif
","
Lawmakers from Balkh province in Afghanistan’s parliament and prominent political figures in Balkh on Tuesday said that hundreds of public uprising forces have been deployed in the main areas of Mazar-e-Sharif city to protect the city from a possible attack by the Taliban.
They said that the Taliban has been pushed back from the main gates of Mazar-e-Sharif, and they pledged that security will be maintained at any cost.
This comes as the Taliban has already taken control of seven districts centers in Balkh. In recent days, insurgents were seen intensifying their attacks in the outskirts of the city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
“If there are assurances about the delivery of weapons and other supplies to our people, there are more than 10,000 young people who are ready to defend Balkh and the north,” said Abbas Ibrahimzada, the head of Hizb-e-Wahdat-e-Naweein Afghanistan party.
On Monday the centers of Balkh, Chimtal, Kashinda, Sholgara and Dawlatabad districts fell to the Taliban. Later on the Taliban intensified attacks near Mazar-e-Sharif city.
“In Dasht-e-Shor, people loyal to Hizb-e-Wahdat-e-Naween have established three to four checkpoints—also toward Balkh district, Jamiat-e-Islami and Harakat-e-Islami have pledged to mobilize the people toward the Nasaji area,” said Raees Abdul Khaliq, a member of parliament.
The political or group affiliations of those who have shown a willingness to operate under the public uprising forces have not yet been confirmed, but Mohammad Farhad Azimi, the governor of Balkh province, said that hundreds of them are supporters of political parties.
“The enemies of the country tried to infiltrate here to Mazar-e-Sharif, we will fight until the last drop of our blood and will defend our country,” said Samiullah, a member of the public uprising force.
The 209 Shaheen Army corps has said that security forces have retaken the center of Balkh from the Taliban. The Taliban has denied this claim.
Officials in Balkh said that Afghan forces will soon launch a clearance operation to retake the territories lost to the Taliban.

Taliban Attacks Prove Group Has Not Changed: Ghani Aide
","
Following repeated attacks by the Taliban in various parts of the country, particularly in the north, President Ghani’s senior adviser Waheed Omer said on Tuesday that the group, with its attacks and “subversive” activities in the last month, has proved that it has not changed at all.  
Addressing a gathering to introduce Brig. Gen. Ajmal Omar Shinwari as spokesman for the security and defense forces, Omer said that recent attacks by the Taliban have caused hopes for peace in Afghanistan to vanish.
“Talib is the one who kills journalists, religious scholars. Talib is the one who goes everywhere and destroys bridges, schools and clinics,” Omer said. 
Moreover, hundreds of tribal elders and locals have taken up arms, forming various groups in Parwan, Kapisa, Baghlan, Kunduz, Takhar and Balkh provinces to fight alongside security forces on the frontlines against the Taliban. 
Some former mujahedeen leaders and residents of Jabal Siraj district in Parwan on Tuesday formed a social council of mujahedeen, warning that they will support the security forces on the frontlines if the Taliban violence continues. 
“Parwan should prepare 10,000 forces to defend Parwan and other neighboring provinces,” said Noor Habib Gulbahari, a former mujahedeen commander in Parwan. 
In Kapisa, a central province that neighbors Parwan and is north of Kabul, a group of former mujahedeen commanders mobilized residents to arm themselves and defend their areas. 
“The people are ready to go to the frontlines and fight international terrorism,” said Mohammad Husain Sanjani, the head of the Kapisa provincial council. 
In Baghlan province in northern Afghanistan, a large number of locals have mobilized to fight the Taliban. 
“Our personnel are on the frontlines. The personnel that you see here are the reserve forces,” said a public uprising forces commander in Baghlan. 
This is the first time that the public has shown a willingness to fight against the Taliban in such large numbers since the group increased its attacks. 
Ata Mohammad Noor, the head of the splinter faction of Jamiat-e-Islami Afghanistan, has pledged to mobilize the public in Balkh against the Taliban and to clear the province and restore stability.
“God forbid, the fall of Balkh means the fall of the north and the fall of the north means the fall of Afghanistan. We have experienced this. It is not a story, it is history,” Noor said. “We will not allow it to fall. We are here with a firm commitment to return security to the people and we will not leave them alone.” 
Some are against the mobilization of the public, saying it will increase the violence. 
“The mobilization of the people by politicians under the pretext of supporting security forces--with the use of public uprising forces--fuels the war from one side and from the other it affects Afghanistan’s stance in foreign policy,” said Habib-ur-Rahman Naqi, a member of the leadership council of Hizb-e-Islami. 
This comes as President Ghani met with influential political leaders on Monday to mobilize politicians to build a national consensus to manage the current situation.

Travel on Afghan Highways Increasingly Dangerous
","
Amid fighting around the country, passengers in northern and southern provinces are worried about the growing security threats on most of the major highways. 
A number of travelers in the north of the country said that the Taliban has set up checkpoints in several areas along the Baghlan-Kunduz Highway.
“The state opponents have captured all highways; now, they have reached up to Dushi in Baghlan province, therefore most of the drivers are faced with problems,” said Wahidullah, a driver on Baghlan-Kundoz Highway.
Zabihullah, a passenger in the north, said: “There are four Taliban checkpoints, from Panjshanba Bazaar to Khenjan, they have parked big trucks in the street and they stop every car that comes.”
The four major highways of the country, including Kabul-Kandahar, Kabul-North, Kabul-Gardiz, and Kabul-Jalalabad are insecure these days, as the Taliban has escalated their attacks on districts and cities across the country.
Among the four major highways in the country, Kabul-Jalalabad Highway is still partly safe in comparison to others, say drivers.
Najibullah, who drives on the Kabul-Kandahar Highway, said: “Passing from Arghandeh, there are Taliban up to Kandahar, they stop everyone and do a body search.”
Samiullah, a traveler on the Kabul-Kandahar Highway, said: “None of the roads are safe and in a good condition, all bridges are destroyed, the Taliban stop people everywhere they find them and do a body search of them.”
Passengers and drivers say that sometimes government vehicles are being targeted and attacked by the Taliban fighters while they are traveling on these highways.
“We were stranded in the highway up to 10 PM, then the Taliban released us,” said Nazir, a driver on the Kabul-North Highway.
“The situation is not good, the Taliban harass passengers,” said Mansour, a passenger on the Kabul-North Highway.
Meanwhile, several passengers on the Kabul-Kandahar Highway said that sometimes clashes between the Taliban and security forces leave people and drivers stranded for hours.
In addition to the presence of the Taliban, the extortion by government forces is another problem that highway drivers complain about.

UN Envoy Criticizes Taliban's ‘Intensive Military Campaign’
","
The UN envoy in Afghanistan Deborah Lyons in a briefing to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday said the recent “intensive military campaign” by the Taliban will lead to continued violence in the country, and she reiterated that any attempt to install a government in Kabul by force will go against everyone’s interest. 
Lyons said the Taliban’s intensive military campaign “will lead to increased and prolonged violence that would extend the suffering of the Afghan people and threaten to destroy much of what has been built and hard won in the last two decades.” 
She said that the Taliban’s recent advances are even more significant and are as a result of an intensified military campaign. More than 50 of Afghanistan’s 370 districts have fallen since the beginning of May.  
Most districts that have been taken surround provincial capitals, suggesting that the Taliban are positioning themselves to try and take these capitals once foreign forces are fully withdrawn.  
“This military campaign runs directly counter to recent statements by the head of the Taliban Political Commission that, and I quote, ‘We are committed to forging ahead with the other sides in an atmosphere of mutual respect and reach an agreement,’” she said. 
For the Taliban to continue this intensive military campaign would be a tragic course of action, Lyons said.  
“It should be emphatically clear that any efforts to install a militarily imposed government in Kabul would go against the will of the Afghan people, and against the stated positions of the regional countries and the broader international community,” she hinted. 
This comes as sources said Tuesday that 13 districts have fallen to the Taliban in the last 24 hours while the government retook control of three districts in the same period. 
The UN envoy said that they hoped to accelerate the stalled negotiations in Doha through a proposed conference in Turkey in April but the Taliban “never officially responded to the invitation.” 
She said that given the enormous suffering, UNAMA stresses the importance of putting victims and their needs at the forefront of the peace negotiations.  
“This must include specific protections for minorities. The ongoing, frequent attacks against the Hazara community in Kabul are a terrible reminder of how the overall conflict is being used to target certain groups,” she added. 
She hinted that there is still time to prevent the worse-case scenario from materializing.  
“We must accept the reality -- increased conflict in Afghanistan means increased insecurity for many other countries, near and far,” she added. “Regional countries have an important role to play in helping Afghanistan to stabilize and integrate more fully into the region.”

Atmar to UN: Taliban Not Fulfilling Commitments
","
Foreign Minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar on Tuesday night spoke to the United Nations Security Council online and said that the Taliban has increased violence against Afghans, especially civilians, despite the foreign troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and he said the group has failed to live up to its commitments. 
The members of the UN Security Council condemned ""in the strongest possible terms"" the recent attacks on schools, deminers in northern Baghlan province and civilians in Afghanistan, the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. 
The Afghan ministry reported that the UN said that the rights of women, children and men are not negotiable under any conditions. 
“The Taliban regime is completely unacceptable, and the international community does not support its return,” MoFA said, adding that the UN statement ""expressed its support for the resumption of meaningful talks that lead to a ceasefire and lasting peace in Afghanistan.”
International participants reassured the country that “they will continue to support the Afghan government, including the security forces, and maintain the achievements of the last two decades,” MoFA said. 
At the meeting, Atmar spoke about the violation of the Taliban's commitments. 
“The Taliban has escalated the violence despite the fact that the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan has begun,” Atmar said. “The Taliban has not fulfilled its commitment to cut ties with regional and international terrorist groups and has not participated in meaningful peace talks for months,”  he said. 
In the meantime, the UN envoy in Afghanistan Deborah Lyons in a briefing to the United Nations Security Council said the recent “intensive military campaign” by the Taliban will lead to continued violence in the country, and she reiterated that any attempt to install a government in Kabul by force will go against everyone’s interest.

Western Alliance Failed to Stabilize Afghan Situation: Russia
","
Russia’s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu at the 9th Moscow Conference on International Security said on Wednesday that the Western alliance has failed to stabilize the situation in Afghanistan. 
“It must be admitted that over 20 years of stay in Afghanistan, a significant military contingent of the Western alliance has failed to achieve significant results in stabilizing the situation in the country and forming sustainable public administration structures,” Shoigu said, according to Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency. 
“There was high probability that after the withdrawal of NATO forces [from Afghanistan] a civil war would resume in the country with all negative consequences:  further deterioration in the life of the population; mass migration; and the spread of extremism to neighboring countries,” he said. 
In the meantime, the deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan amid the withdrawal of foreign forces causes ever growing concerns, Russian Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Anna Yevstigneyeva said during the UN Security Council meeting on Afghanistan Tuesday, TASS News agency reported. 
""Today’s meeting takes place amid the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan, announced on April 14. The degrading situation causes ever-growing concerns,"" she said. ""The balance of power today does not look promising. Violence is rampant across the country."" 
""Just like twenty years ago, the terrorist threat remains a serious challenge in Afghanistan,"" she said, adding that the ""situation with drug production and drug trafficking"" also causes concerns. 
""In this regard, we note with regret that the peace process has stalled. We see that attempts to organize an international meeting were unsuccessful,"" the Russian envoy said. According to Yevstigneyeva,"" the success depends on the scrupulous work (of) all sides.""

“Mr. Karzai has made many attempts to create a political and national consensus and he continues these efforts, but the question is: Who is creating the barriers? The people can judge that,” said Shahzada Massoud, a top aide to former president Hamid Karzai.
“I am really surprised about our politicians, they meet ten times a week, but no outcome emerges,” said Sayed Eshaq Gailani, the head of Nahzat-e-Hambastagi Milli party.
However, the Presidential Palace has said that the president has held several meetings in the past days with prominent political leaders in the country.
“In the political sphere, whether inside or outside the govt, there is consensus about one thing and that is we are united to combat the enemies,” said Wahid Omar, a top aide to President Ghani.

Turkey Will Not Send More Troops for Kabul Airport Security
","
Turkey will not send additional troops to Afghanistan as part of a plan to run and secure the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul after US and NATO forces leave the country.
This comes as Turkey has offered to take the security and run the airport after troops withdrawal from Afghanistan. 
TRT reports that a US delegation is expected to travel to Turkey to discuss Kabul airport's security on Thursday, according to Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar.
Quoted by TRT, Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said on Wednesday that Turkey had a military presence in Afghanistan working under NATO's Resolute Support Mission to guard the airport for six years. 
He said details of the plan were still being discussed. 
TRT reports that Ankara has said it cannot carry out the mission without support.

130 Taliban Members Join Peace Process in Herat: Officials
","
A group of 130 Taliban members laid down their weapons and joined the peace process in the western province of Herat on Thursday morning, local officials said. 
The group was active in the Zer-e-Koh district of Herat province, according to officials.
Mardan Noorzai, the leader of the group, said that “with the withdrawal of foreign forces from the country, the time of jihad is over, and we will no longer continue to fight the country's military.”  
Abdul Saboor Qane, provincial governor, said that with the joining of these men in the peace process, ""security will improve in Zer-e-Koh and Shindand districts of the province.” 
“These men will be sent back to Zer-e-Koh in support of the security force members in fighting against the Taliban,” he said. 
The Taliban has not yet commented.
This comes as clashes are ongoing in some parts of the country, especially in the north of Afghanistan. 
Sources confirmed on Thursday that six district centers have fallen into Taliban control since last night: two districts (Qaramqul and Grezwan) in Faryab, Charcheno district in Uruzgan, Tala wa Barfak in Baghlan, Arza in Logar and Qarabagh district in Ghazni province. 
On April 14, US President Joe Biden announced that US troops will leave Afghanistan by September 11. Following the announcement, the Taliban attacks have escalated in the country. 
The UN envoy in Afghanistan Deborah Lyons in a briefing to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday night said the recent “intensive military campaign” by the Taliban will lead to continued violence in the country, and she reiterated that any attempt to install a government in Kabul by force will go against everyone’s interest.   
Lyons said the Taliban’s intensive military campaign “will lead to increased and prolonged violence that would extend the suffering of the Afghan people and threaten to destroy much of what has been built and hard-won in the last two decades.”   
She said that the Taliban’s recent advances are even more significant and are the result of an intensified military campaign. More than 50 of Afghanistan’s 370 districts have fallen since the beginning of May, she said.  
Most districts that have been taken are adjacent to provincial capitals, suggesting that the Taliban are positioning themselves to try and take these capitals once foreign forces are fully withdrawn, she noted.    
“This military campaign runs directly counter to recent statements by the head of the Taliban Political Commission that, and I quote, ‘We are committed to forging ahead with the other sides in an atmosphere of mutual respect (to) reach an agreement,’” she said.   
For the Taliban to continue this intensive military campaign would be a tragic course of action, Lyons said.

On Ghani and Abdullah's meeting with Biden, Psaki said: “A part of their discussion on Friday will certainly be the president reiterating his commitment to work with the government of Afghanistan to continue to provide humanitarian support, over-the-horizon security work that he committed to when he made this announcement. And I'm sure they'll discuss this during their meeting on Friday.""
Fighting has escalated and dozens of districts have fallen to the Taliban since May 1, when US and NATO troops began their final departure from Afghanistan.

Karzai Calls on Major Powers, Region to Help Stabilize Country
","
Afghanistan’s former president Hamid Karzai said that the escalation of the war in Afghanistan is inflicting a devastating toll on the nation’s infrastructures and national assets.
In an address to the 9th Moscow Conference on International Security, the former president called on major powers and countries in the region to work together for peace in Afghanistan and for stability in the region.
Referring to the attack on the Sayed al-Shuhada girls school in western Kabul on May 8, Karzai called on the regional countries to support Afghanistan in the peace process. 
“Conflict has increased, insecurity has increased and Afghanistan is again facing an uncertain future. It is time for our larger region and major powers and our neighbors to play a more stronger and proactive role for bringing peace and stability to Afghanistan,” said Karzai.
“Three years ago, the United States launched a peace process for Afghanistan and the Afghan people wholeheartedly supported this peace process as it is the overwhelming desire of the Afghan people ... our peace, and for that reason, the US was given wholehearted support with the hopes and expectations that this will happen soon, but it has been three years the peace process is still going on while the situation in the country is worsening with more casualties,  with more conflict, with more uncertainty for Afghanistan and this region,” said Karzai.
Meanwhile, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu at the same event said that Afghanistan could be pushed into a civil war after the withdrawal of US forces from the country.
“The situation in Afghanistan requires the particular attention both from the neighboring countries and also the international organizations. It is necessary to admit that over the past 20 years, the presence of the western allies, they still haven’t managed to share real results. After the withdrawal of NATO forces, we can have another civil war,” said Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu.
“In the view of US withdrawal, the regional countries should try to ensure their longstanding security,” said Mahdi Rabbani, the deputy head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).
This comes a day after a Wall Street Journal article citing US intelligence officials said that the government of Afghanistan could collapse as soon as six months after the American military withdrawal from the country is completed.
“The new assessment of the overall US intelligence community, which hasn’t been previously reported, has now aligned more closely with the analysis that had been generated by the US military. The military has already withdrawn more than half of its 3,500 troops and its equipment, with the rest due to be out by Sept. 11,” the Wall Street Journal wrote.

McConnell Meets Afghan Leaders, Seeks Delay in Troop Withdrawal

US Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday met with President Ashraf Ghani, Abdullah Abdullah the chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation and other Afghan officials who accompany the president in his two-day visit to the United States.
In meeting with President Ghani at the Capitol, McConnell said he hopes President Biden will delay the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan.
“President Biden’s decision to withdraw US forces leaves our Afghan partners alone to confront threats that his own top advisors acknowledge are grave and growing worse,” McConnel said, according to a statement released by his office.
“The Taliban, emboldened by our retreat, is rolling back years of progress, especially for the rights of Afghan women, on its way to taking Kabul,” he said, adding that “increasing indications that this collapse could come soon after US withdrawal is complete are as tragic as they are avoidable.”
He said that in the Taliban’s wake, al-Qaeda is already preparing for an ambitious resurgence of its own, which the President’s own Defense Secretary warns could lead to direct threats to the US homeland in as little as two years.
“Without a reversal of US policy, I suspect this threat will come much more quickly,” he said. 
“President Ghani and the people of Afghanistan are entitled to wonder why the Biden Administration has chosen to abandon the fight and invite even greater terrorist threats,” McConnell said. “They are right to expect answers about how the United States will honor its commitments to brave Afghans who have helped US forces, and how we will assist in mitigating the security and humanitarian fallout of a Taliban takeover.
McConnell said that he hopes the Biden Administration will delay the withdrawal, address these concerns, and reconsider its misguided retreat. 
“As President Ghani and the Afghan people know, the threats we face from terrorism and tyranny have not been defeated,” he concluded.
The Afghan delegation also met with US Senator Jim Risch, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
“I have deep reservations about the decision to withdraw all American forces from Afghanistan by September 11 without a plan to ensure critical counterterrorism operations can still take place – there are options in-between departing Afghanistan entirely or remaining there forever. I am concerned this decision severely hampers any chances of a negotiated peace, and puts our hard-fought counterterrorism gains at risk,” Risch said. 
He said that their discussion was useful but said that “it’s unfortunate that we must discuss how to avoid a worse outcome in Afghanistan.”

Hundreds Take Up Arms Across Afghanistan in Support of ANDSF
","
Hundreds of people, many of them armed, on Friday poured into streets in 10 provinces of the country to raise their voice in support of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), announcing their preparation to fight the Taliban.
Those who rallied on streets said they will not allow the Taliban to take over their villages.
In northern Takhar province, a number of women went to the frontline where they distributed food and fruits to the security forces who are battling the Taliban in the area.
“It will be good if we Afghans sit together instead of killing each other,” said Mohammad Asher Arab, a tribal elder from Takhar.
“As well as in Farkhar district, the security forces in cooperation with the people dealt major blow to the enemy,” Takhar Police Chief Ekramuddin Sari said.
The northern province of Sar-e-Pul is one of the provinces where the Taliban has taken over several districts. Many residents of the province have taken up arms to fight the Taliban.
“We are taking up arms to mobilize the second generation of resistance to fight against the dark regime of the Taliban, so we will defend until the last drop of our blood,” said Ghulam Sakhi, a resident in Ghor province.
“We will wait until next week. If the lost territory is not retaken by the security forces, we will act on our own,” said Mohammad Noor Rahmani, the head of Ghor provincial council.
In Khost province, dozens of residents have taken up arms to fight the Taliban.
At least 200 residents of Zabul led by governor Hamidullah Tokhi have taken up arms for the fight against the Taliban, local officials said.
Moreover, some influential political figures have mobilized hundreds of armed men to support the Afghan forces on the battlefields.
“No one should think that with these takeovers, the Taliban has been equipped and will transfer the tanks to Punjab,” Deputy Minister of Interior Naqibullah Fayeq, who has traveled to Baghlan, said.

Residents Protest NDS Raid That Killed 5 People
","
At least five people were killed in an operation by the National Directorate of Security (NDS) forces in Deh Yahya village in Deh Sabz district, east of the city of Kabul, sources said.
The operation was slammed by residents of the village who claimed that ""innocent"" were killed in the raid.
Dozens of people from the area held a rally in front of the district governor's office while carrying the coffins of those who claimed were killed in the operation.
Security officials have not commented so far.
“Ashraf Ghani, Amrullah Saleh, for God sake, address the plight of the people in Deh Yahya, otherwise, we will go to the mountain,” said Sayed Ahmad Shah, brother of one of the victims.
“They were thieves, they didn’t behave like government. They killed my brother and slapped my father,” said Safiullah, brother of a victim.
“At 6:00am when the family went out to bring wood, they saw that he was martyred,” said Dad-e-Khuda, a relative of one of the men killed in the operarion.
Meanwhile, armed men loyal to MP Allah Gul Mujahid were deployed around Deh Sabz.
“I will arm you even if it cost my life and we will stand against the oppression,” said MP Allah Gul Mujahid.
The raid was conducted on the house of local elder Sayed Mahboob who was killed along with his son. The other two sons of Sayed Mahboob serve in the Ministry of Interior Affairs.
“The coordination report was wrong. They (NDS) swiftly acted and committed this crime,” said Sayed Ahmad Shah, brother of Sayed Mahmood who was killed in the raid.
Residents of the area said that the security forces conducted operation on four houses including the house of Haji Ehsan.
Ehsan’s family members said that the security forces arrested him, but they found his body the next morning near their home.
The NDS and the Ministry of Interior did not comment on the raid. But Deh Sabz district governor said that the operation was carried out without any coordination.

Afghan Forces Retake 6 Districts from Taliban: Defense Ministry
","
Afghan forces retook the control of six districts from the Taliban in three provinces in the last 24 hours, major progress following the back-to-back fall of territory to the militants.
The districts include Andkhoi and Khan Chahar Bagh in Faryab, Khinjan and Doshi in Baghlan, and Ahmad Aba and Sayed Karam in Paktia.
At the same time, sources said that three districts -- Khost Firing and Guzargah-e-Noor in Baghlan and Dolina in Ghor -- have fallen to the Taliban in the last 24 hours.
This comes as heavy fighting is underway between the Afghan security forces and the Taliban in several areas in the country, particularly in the northern provinces of Baghlan, Kunduz, Faryab, and Sar-e-Pul.
“The enemy has no longer a line. They suffered massive casualties and were pushed back,” said Abdul Basir Salangi, a senior adviser to High Council for National Reconciliation, who has gone to Salang district in Parwan to support security forces.
“All resources are available. The security forces have enough strength. What we need is high morale and strong determination. Our security forces are ready to fight the enemy,” said MP Sadiq Qaderi.
Meanwhile, the US State Department has said that Washington was assessing to find out whether the Taliban is willing to end the conflict through a diplomatic solution or insists on the military takeover of Afghanistan.
""We're looking very carefully at the situation on the ground in Afghanistan, and we're also looking very hard at whether the Taliban is at all serious about a peaceful resolution to the conflict. We continue to be engaged in diplomacy, but actions that would try to take the country by force are of course totally inconsistent with finding a peaceful resolution,” said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
Recent clashes have displaced many families in various provinces. 
“A mortar landed. Several people were wounded and martyred,” said Bashir Ahmad, a wounded person in Kunduz.
Sources have told TOLOnews that a vehicle belonged to public uprising forces in Shinwari district was attacked in Dara-e-Ghorband in which three of these forces were killed and nine others were wounded.
“Our brave security and defense forces are advancing. City belts are very strong,” said Najibullah Amarkhel, acting governor of Kunduz.
“We have cleared those areas that had fallen to the enemy. We are ready to redeploy our forces,” Faryab police chief Ghaibullah Sadat said.

Biden Vows ‘Sustained’ Partnership as He Meets Afghan Leaders
","
President Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, met with US President Joe Biden at the White House on Friday, a key meeting that happens amidst fragile security situation in the country as the international troops are leaving. 
In this meeting, Biden promised the Afghan leaders a “sustained” partnership even as he moves to accelerate winding down the US’s longest war in Afghanistan.
President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah also met at the Pentagon with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.
While Biden vowed that the US was committed to assisting Afghanistan, he also insisted that it was time for the American military to step back, according to The Associated Press report.
“Afghans are going to have to decide their future,” Biden said in brief remarks at the start of his meeting with the Afghan leaders. He did not elaborate more about a ’’sustained” partnership with Afghanistan.
Biden emphasized enduring United States support for the Afghan people, including Afghan women, girls, and minorities, through civilian, development, and humanitarian aid, as well as the continued provision of security assistance to support Afghan National Defense and Security Forces.
He expressed his concern about the recent increase in COVID-19 cases in Afghanistan, and noted additional emergency US assistance, including three million doses of vaccines, to help the Afghan government respond to the pandemic, according to a White House statement. 
President Biden, President Ghani, and Chairman Abdullah concurred on the need for unity among Afghan leaders in support of peace and stability, and President Biden reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to fully support intra-Afghan negotiations, the statement said. 
The US and Afghan leaders firmly agreed that although US troops are leaving Afghanistan, the strong bilateral partnership will continue, the statement added.
Abdullah Abdullah, head of the reconciliation council, said that US President Joe Biden in his meeting with the Afghan delegation stressed on Afghan unity, continued support and an end to ""senseless violence"" in Afghanistan.
Abdullah said that Biden reassured them that American assistance will not end as the US prepares to end its military presence in Afghanistan.
""We expressed our appreciation for US sacrifices and generous assistance over the years, discussed key issues and stressed on a negotiated political settlement to end the war, enhance stability and allow the Afghan people to determine their own future,"" Abdullah said.
Ahead of his meeting with Biden, President Ghani met with US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“As we enter a new phase of that relationship, we look forward to hearing from you how we can do so with humanitarian assistance,” Pelosi said in a press briefing with Ghani. 
“We look forward to having a conversation about how we strengthen our relationship through humanitarian assistance,” Pelosi said. “Our friendship is one that is deep and personal, and one that we value. Again, this visit that you are making to the Capitol is an important one for both of our countries, certainly for us.”
Ghani said that the decision of President Biden has been a strategic decision and that “we respect it.” 
“It is dealing with a new chapter of our friendship; our strategic relationship and our people to people relationship and government to government relationship that we have focused on,” Ghani said.
Addressing a news conference after the Oval Office meeting, Ghani said that the talks with Biden were productive. 
He pointed to an increase in Afghans signing up for the military as a sign of hope. But he also acknowledged the difficulty that lies ahead. He said that the decision by President Biden is not the abandonment of Afghanistan, but it is a new chapter in Kabul-Washington ties.
“There have been reverses, we acknowledge it — but the key now is stabilization,” he added.
In a meeting with Afghan leaders, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the United States remains committed to continuing to provide critical security assistance to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces.
""I am confident that as Resolute Support begins to wind down, we will make the transition to a new relationship with Afghanistan and the Afghan forces, one that continues to help you meet your responsibilities to your citizens, and we will remain partners with the Afghan government and the Afghan military, and we will continue to work toward our common goal in -- in new and different ways,"" he said.

President Ghani Says Afghans Will Not Bow to Force
","
President Ashraf Ghani on Friday said that Afghans will not be compelled to submission by force and that the Taliban should agree to a ceasefire and enter a political process.
Addressing a press conference following his meetings with US President Joe Biden, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other American officials and lawmakers, Ghani said that the Afghan forces are prepared to ensure the country’s security and that he respects the decision by the United States to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan.
“Force is not a way to compel an Afghan to submission. We still call on them to have a ceasefire and to engage in a political process because a political settlement is the ultimate mechanism of ending a war. As Lincoln said the best way of treating an enemy to turn him into a friend,” he said.
Ghani said that a new chapter has been opened in Kabul-Washington relations following the announcement of the withdrawal of troops from the country.
“We respect this decision,” Ghani said. “It is dealing with a new chapter of our friendship; our strategic relationship and our people-to-people relationship and government to government relationship that we have focused on,” he added.
Meanwhile, Abdullah Abdullah, Chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation who accompanied President Ghani in his trip to the US, said the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan will not stop talks with the Taliban unless the group shuts the doors for negotiations.
“The absolute majority of the people of Afghanistan, they want a peaceful settlement, inclusive peaceful settlement,” Abdullah said in an interview with Reuters. “Without it, what is the scenario? Continue fighting forever? That’s not a solution.”
He added: “There was perhaps some optimism when negotiations started during the Trump administration that Taliban may be willing because they had shown those signs that had created an optimism.”
This comes as Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan in an interview with The New York Times has said that his country will not take military action against the Taliban if they carry out a full military takeover of Afghanistan.
Violence remains high in the country amidst stalled peace negotiations. Several districts are contested between the Afghan forces and the Taliban, and many are retaken by security forces or fall to the group every day.

Pakistan Won’t Take Military Action against Afghan Taliban: Khan
","
Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Friday that his country will not take military action against the Taliban if the group takes over Afghanistan by force.
Quoted in an article by The New York Times, Khan said that “Pakistan will only recognize a government which is chosen by the people of Afghanistan, whichever government they choose.”
“Let me assure you, we will do everything except use military action against the Taliban,” Khan replied when asked what Pakistan would do if the Taliban took over Afghanistan by force. “I mean, we will do everything up to that. All sections of our society have decided that Pakistan will take no military action.”
“Now, we are fencing it, and almost 90 percent of the border, we’ve fenced now,” Khan said. “What if [the] Taliban try to take over Afghanistan through [the] military? Then we will seal the border because now we can, because we have fenced our border, which was previously [open], because Pakistan does not want to get into, number one, conflict, secondly, we do not want another influx of refugees.”
Khan said that after the US withdrawal, he wished that Pakistan and the US could fix their “lopsided” equation of the past. 
The remarks come as violence remains high in the country following a sharp rise in the Taliban’s offensives against government forces. Afghan forces retook the control of seven districts from the Taliban in three provinces in the last 24 hours.

Taliban Trying to Take Military Equipment to Pakistan: Official
","
A senior Afghan security official claimed that the Taliban is making efforts to take military equipment, including tanks, to Pakistan -- as the group continues to take over various districts, security outposts and military bases that house dozens of vehicles, tanks and others.
Acting Interior Minister Gen. Abdul Sattar Mirzakwal who visited the eastern province of Paktia on Saturday said his remarks were based on intelligence information he has received.
“There is also information that the Taliban take some (military) tanks to Pakistan through Zabul province (in southern Afghanistan),” the acting interior minister said. “The National Security Council and the commander in chief have ordered permanent patrols to target any tank that is tried to be taken to Pakistan.”
Another high-ranking official at the same event echoed the minister's remarks by saying that some military equipment has been transferred across the Durand Line – the de facto border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
“They have taken military equipment owned by security forces across the Durand Line,” said Shamim Khan Katawazai, head of the Independent Directorate of Local Governance. “There are evidence and footage about this. Pakistani soldiers have clicked photos with them.”
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid rejected the claims on the transfer of military equipment by the group to Pakistan.
This comes as heavy fighting is underway in Paktia between security forces and the Taliban for the last week. Security forces retook Ahmad Aba and Mirzaka districts in Paktia from the Taliban in the last three days.
Paktia officials said that they have arrested Pakistani nationals who fought in the ranks of the Taliban during their operations. 
Mirzaka district fell to the Taliban three days ago. Most parts of the district, especially government buildings, have been damaged in the clashes or have been set on fire as officials described.
Local officials claimed that the Taliban ""has set ablaze"" many security outposts and have ""destroyed"" some roads.
“Unfortunately, they (Taliban) burn and destroyed government establishments. They don’t have another message,” Paktia governor Halim Fedaee said.
The 203 Corps Commander Gen. Jalaluddin Yaftali said that military operations are underway to retake seven Paktia districts that have fallen to the Taliban.
“They have made destructions in all districts,” Gen. Yaftali said. “They have broken glasses. They have set ablaze some establishments.”
Taliban has rejected the claims by security officials.
Paktia has 14 districts. At least 10 of them have fallen to the Taliban recently, but three, including Ahmad Aba, Mirzaka and Sayed Karam, were retaken while the group still has influence over Janikhil, Dand-e-Patan, Samkanai, Zazai Aryub, Ahmadkhil, Lazha Mangal and Rouhani Baba districts.

Those who rallied in support of Afghan forces have said that they believe in peace, but will defend the democratic values at any cost.
So far, hundreds of people have taken up arms against the Taliban in Takhar, Balkh, Badghis, Baghlan, Nangarhar, Laghman, Jawzjan, Samangan and Kapisa provinces.
“The security forces are not alone. We are with them,” said Nazir Ahmad, a member of public uprising forces in Herat.

Also in Kunduz province, a large number of people took up arms to support the Afghan forces in the fight against the militants.
“If you are fleeing Kunduz today, I want to tell you that a man dies one time, but a weak person dies each day,” said Rabbani Rabbani, member of Kunduz provincial council, referring to reports that some local officials had fled Kunduz following increased attacks by the Taliban.
People in northern Baghlan province have also taken up arms to fight the Taliban.
“The war is not the solution for conflict in Afghanistan. There is a good opportunity for the Taliban to agree on peace,” said MP Azim Mohseni.
Afghan security officials said that the government will never support the existence of militia forces, however all those who have taken up arms will be operating within the structure of Afghan forces.
The acting minister of interior Gen. Abdul Sattar Mirzakwal said that the government will add another 30,000 personnel to the ranks of the Afghan Local Police (ALP) and those who have taken up arms to fight will operate within the structure of the local police.
“We do not support building militia and will not allow it to happen. 30,000 people have been approved to serve in our military structure,” Mirzakwal said.
“The way this process has stared indicates a sign of danger,” said Rahmatullah Nabil, former head of the National Directorate of Security.
Referring to the recent waves of public uprising campaigns in several regions of Afghanistan, a Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid has said that these moves are part of the government's attempts.

“Children and women are among the victims. 95% of the casualties are civilians,” said Ehsanullah Fazli, the head of the Kunduz public health directorate. 
“The Afghan defense and security agencies have always been successful in providing security to Afghanistan. Unfortunately, the people who have been in the leadership have acted politically and with nepotism,” said Sayed Hassan Paktiawal, an MP.

Saleh Calls Ghani Trip to US 'Highly Productive'
","
First Vice President Amrullah Saleh said on Sunday that President Ashraf Ghani’s two-day trip to the United States was highly productive and significant achievements were made during the delegation's short stay in Washington.
President Ghani was accompanied by Abdullah Abdullah, head of the High Council for National Reconciliation, First Vice President Saleh, National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib, Foreign Minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar and peace negotiator Matin Bek. 
Ghani and the delegation accompanying him met with US President Joe Biden, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and a large number of US lawmakers, including US Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.  
Saleh highlighted 10 points in a statement as key achievements in Ghani’s trip to the United States. 
He said that the main goal of the day-and-a-half trip of the president to the US was to strengthen relations with the US after the withdrawal of its military from the country and to create more clarity regarding the breadth of cooperation. 
He said that discussion focused on ways to implement and effectively utilize aid for security, defense, development and humanitarian assistance from the US.
He said that the delegation explained the complications of the peace process and the peace negotiations from the perspective of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, and stated that the Republic has so far not withdrawn from its commitment to the talks or to ending the conflict through a political solution. 
Saleh added that during the trip the Afghan delegation emphasized the importance of the Afghan Republic’s principled and legitimate function in defending the soil and state sovereignty. 
He said they also highlighted the region’s role in post-withdrawal Afghanistan through an economic-centric forum that was focused on Afghanistan's participation in the region. 
Saleh said that President Ghani reiterated that Afghanistan respects the US’s decision to fully withdraw its troops from the country.  
Key leaders from both parties in the US welcomed the Afghan delegation and vowed continued commitment to Afghanistan, Saleh said. 
He added that the US president told them that ""the Afghan nation should know that I am their friend in the White House.""  
Biden assured them that the narrative of the US backing out from its commitments to Afghanistan is wrong and baseless and that the US will not leave behind its friends and allies, Saleh said.
He added that Biden pledged that the United States will continue its assistance to the Afghan defense and security forces, and continue to provide economic, humanitarian and diplomatic support to Afghanistan. 
Saleh said they had an off-the-record meeting with a group of Afghanistan’s friends that included former ambassadors, former military members, development workers and analysts to discuss Afghanistan’s situation. 
The trip comes as the level of violence remains high in the country amid the Taliban’s increasing offensives against Afghan forces. 
In a meeting with Afghan leaders on Friday, Biden promised a “sustained” partnership with Afghanistan but reiterated that “Afghans are going to have to decide their future.”

Clashes between government forces and the Taliban have reached the outskirts of Charikar City in the central province of Parwan – 63 kilometers north of Kabul – but troops on the ground have not received orders from the center to retake the collapsed areas from the militants. 
 
The control of two districts in Parwan, Siah Gerd district and Shinwari, fell to the Taliban in the last few days.  
 
TOLOnews reporter Khaled Nikzad, who visited the frontlines in the Dara-e-Ghorband area of Parwan, said public uprising forces have joined the security and defense forces to fight the Taliban. 
 
“Taliban are now in the position to make advances and we will not allow them to make advances toward Charikar City,” said Hasibullah, a police officer in Parwan. 
 
Some troops on the frontlines said they are fighting with less equipment than the militants facing them.
 
“All these mujahedeen that you see here are waiting for an order to fight against this evil group and save the people from them,” said Aziz Agha, member of public uprising forces. 
 
“If you (Talibs) are killed you are from the Afghan nation, and if security forces are martyred they are also from this nation. We should try to come together,” said Qazi Amin, a member of public uprising forces, referring to unity among the people.  
 
Parwan residents said that the increase in Taliban attacks on Ghorband – 50 kilometers from Kabul – has raised concerns about their safety. 
 
“If attention is not paid to the Dara-e-Ghorband valley, it is likely the Taliban will enter Charikar,” said Hashmat, a Parwan resident. 
 
“The forces should be supported to protect the city,” said Khanullah, a Parwan resident. 
 
But local officials in the province said that efforts to retake the lost areas have started. 
 
“The security forces are there and they will soon push back the enemy and will not allow it to advance,” said Abdul Wase, Security Officer at Parwan Police Headquarters.

Two army commanders on Sunday said the Taliban made multiple combined attacks overnight attempting to break key defense areas in the northern city of Pul-e-Khumri, but their attempts failed as they faced resistance by security forces.
One of these attacks in the Block Ha area in Pul-e-Khumri continued for three hours, commando forces said. 
“Their attacks continued last night, but we resisted and there is no issue and we have enough equipment and personnel,” said Imam Hassan, an army commander in Baghlan. 
However, residents pay the highest price as many of them have been displaced. One resident of the city, Mohammad Azim, said his home has changed into a stronghold, and he has lost assets and his cousin was killed.

“The Taliban came from one direction, and I went to the roof and told them to allow me to leave and then they can do anything here. They told me that they will not do anything. They told me that tanks will come, I said they will not fire. I asked them not to open fire. But they opened fire and I escaped with my nephew but he was martyred,” Azim said. 
Some public uprising forces who have gone to Pul-e-Khumri city from Narin district in Baghlan said they have been stationed in the Band-e-Do area to prevent the Taliban from entering the northern city. 
“This is the frontline. The Taliban are on the other side of those gardens that have been connected to the Dand-e-Shahabuddin area,” said Imam, commander of public uprising forces in Nahrin district. 
Another resident of the city, Mohammad Aziz, a young man, who looks after his home alone and has sent his family members to a safe place, had a story similar to Azim's.
“People have left. These homes have been turned into strongholds,” Aziz said. 
The Taliban started their offensives on Pul-e-Khumri 10 days ago and so far clashes are underway on the outskirts of the city while the key highway that connects Kabul with the north has remained closed to traffic during this time.

Five Districts Fall to Taliban in 24 Hours
","
Five districts have fallen to the Taliban in the last 24 hours, including Shor Tapa in Balkh, Chak and Sayed Abad in Maidan Wardak, Rustaq in Takhar and Arghistan in Kandahar, adding another layer of complexity to the alarming situation that has emerged following the fall of territory to the militant group.
Takhar lawmakers in Parliament said Rustaq is the 13th district in the northeastern province that has fallen to the Taliban in recent weeks.
“The Shirkhan border town is fully under Taliban control. Reports indicate that Aqina border town has also collapsed and Ai Khanum town, that shares a border with Tajikistan in Dasht-e-Qala district, is also under threat,” said Hamiduddin Yuldash, an MP from Takhar.
The fall of strategic districts in the north, south and west has created concerns over the possible infiltration of Taliban into the income-generating territory in the country, including the Shirkhan town in Kunduz on the border with Tajikistan.
Kunduz's provincial council and a private sector entity said that they are concerned about the loss of Shirkhan's incomes to the Taliban and warned of threats posed to other border towns – the Aqina border town in Faryab and Ai Khanum in Takhar.
“Security problems have increased recently. Sometimes the customs department and the finance ministry tries to transfer its employees from one place to another,” said Hujjat Fazli, the CEO of Harakat, an entity facilitating investment opportunities for the private sector.
“We ask the government to pay serious attention to Shirkhan border town, to retake it,” said Khaluddin Hakimi, a member of the Kunduz provincial council.
Meanwhile, Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum, former vice president, warned the Taliban that he will return to Jawzjan in the near future and will suppress the Taliban after consultation with the president.
“I will begin my work. I will suppress them. I am calling on the security forces to come to me when I arrive,” Dostum told TOLOnews.
The deputy minister of interior for policy, Naqibullah Fayiq, said that the Taliban’s focus is on income-generating areas, including border towns, but pledged that these areas will be cleared of the group.
He said that 11 districts have been retaken from the Taliban in the last three days.
Figures collected by TOLOnews indicate that 108 districts have fallen to the Taliban in the last two months, but security forces have retaken 10 of the districts during this period.

Hundreds More Take Up Arms as Clashes Intensify
","
As clashes continue and intensify, hundreds more have taken up arms against the Taliban in support of the government forces, this time in Herat, Patkia, Ghor and Kunduz provinces.
Those who took up arms said they will not allow their villages to fall to the Taliban who they claim would damage the country’s infrastructure. 
So far, hundreds of people have taken up arms against the Taliban in Takhar, Balkh, Badghis, Baghlan, Nangarhar, Laghman, Jawzjan, Samangan and Kapisa provinces. 
People in over 10 districts have taken up arms against the Taliban in just a week following the back-to-back fall of dozens of districts to the group.  
Sources said that since Saturday evening, five districts fell to the Taliban – including Sayed Abad and Chak-e-Wardak in Maidan Wardak, Rustaq in Takhar, Arghistan in Kandahar and Shortepa in Balkh. 
During this period, the government forces have had some progress but have not reported recapturing any district. 
“Paktia residents pledge to the government and the security agencies that we are with you,” said Abdul Mallik Zazai, head of the provincial council in Paktia. 
Some residents of Enjil district in Herat who have taken up arms warned the Taliban to quit violence or they will face resistance from the people. 
“We pledge to the people that we will defend the country until the last drop of our blood,” Farid Ahmad, a public uprising force member. 
In Ghor and Kunduz as well, people say they have been left with no option but to take up arms to fight the Taliban.
“We will suppress the Taliban wherever they are. We will always support our security forces,” said Abdul Rahman, a Ghor resident who has taken up arms. 
“We prevented the enemy from advancing. And we are supporting the government,” said Khalid, a Kunduz resident who has taken up arms. 
Some politicians said that arming the people is a serious need given the current situation and they welcome this move, but they expressed their concerns about its consequences if the forces are not managed well. 
“Those who lead these forces should be responsible so that when the fighting is over they will not create any problems for Afghanistan,” said Asadullah Saadati, the deputy head of the High Council for National Reconciliation. 
The Presidential Palace said recent moves in the last few weeks are in favor of the Republic. 
“The people of Afghanistan, by supporting the security and defense forces and the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, joined the united umbrella of the Republic,” presidential spokesman Latif Mahmoud said. 
The Ministry of Defense assured that the activities of the public forces will be well managed. 
“The mobilization of the people in support of the security and defense forces has had a considerable role in retaking territories, especially in the north, and has prevented the fall of some areas,” Defense Ministry spokesman Fawad Aman said. 
The Taliban called those who have taken up arms “Arbakis” and warned that they will not be forgiven.

Dostum Vows to Return to North, Suppress Taliban
","
Former vice president Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum, who is in Turkey for treatment, said Sunday he will soon return to his home province of Jawzjan in northern Afghanistan to suppress the Taliban in the north, after consultation with President Ghani and the Defense Ministry.
“I predicted this years ago,” Dostum said, referring to Taliban offensives in northern provinces. “All districts, tanks were handed over to the Taliban without resistance. I don’t know what the plan is?”
He said that the reason behind the fall of the districts should be investigated.
“We have seen such issues many times. I was telling them that such a situation will come and I asked Mr. President to assign someone capable because even your security guard will not remain beside you the next day,” Dostum said. “Now that such a situation has come, we will come to the north, it is our home, I have been raised there… I will be proud if I am killed and martyred there.”  
Dostum called on the security forces and public uprising members to not surrender to the Taliban and to continue fighting against the group. 
“I will never leave the territory,” he pledged, saying that he will definitely return. 
This comes as the Taliban has intensified their offensives against Afghan forces on multiple fronts. So far over the last two months, over 100 districts have fallen to the group. 
Five districts have fallen to the Taliban in the last 24 hours, including Shor Tapa in Balkh, Chak and Sayed Abad in Maidan Wardak, Rustaq in Takhar and Arghistan in Kandahar, adding another layer of complexity to the alarming situation that has emerged following the fall of territory to the militant group.

People Will Defend Country If War Imposed: Abdullah
","
Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, on Monday at a press conference said that the Afghan people will defend the country if war is imposed on them.  
“Peace was always the demand of the people of Afghanistan, but if the war has been imposed on them, they have no choice but to defend themselves,"" Abdullah said, “however, peace efforts are ongoing.”
“My message in the last meeting with Taliban representatives in Moscow was that both sides will not reach a result by force--by war. This will not be possible if the Taliban try to reach their target militarily,” Abdullah said.  
In a meeting with US President Biden in Washington, Abdullah said that Biden pledged that the US “will be with the people of Afghanistan in the peace process and will also continue to support the Afghan security forces.” 
“The US president also emphasized the need for political consensus,” he said. 
Abdullah said that the US will end its military presence in the country but will continue its assistance to Afghanistan.  
On Friday, President Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah met with Biden at the White House and the US president promised a “sustained” partnership, said the Afghan leaders.
President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah also met at the Pentagon with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.
While Biden vowed that the US was committed to assisting Afghanistan, he also insisted that it was time for the American military to step back, according to the Associated Press.
On Friday, President Ghani said that Afghans will not be compelled by force and that the Taliban should agree to a ceasefire and enter a political process. 
Ghani spoke at a press conference following meetings with President Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other American officials and lawmakers, and said that the Afghan forces are prepared to ensure the country’s security and that he respects the decision by the United States to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan. 
“Force is not a way to compel an Afghan to submission. We still call on them to have a ceasefire and to engage in a political process because a political settlement is the ultimate mechanism of ending a war. As Lincoln said, the best way of treating an enemy is to turn him into a friend,” he said. 
Violence remains high in the country amid stalled peace negotiations. Several districts are contested between the Afghan forces and the Taliban.

Pakistan Minister: Families of Afghan Taliban Live in Islamabad
","
Pakistan's interior minister, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, during an interview with Geo News said that families of Afghan Taliban reside in his country, including in the capital city of Islamabad.  
He also said the Taliban receive medical treatment in Pakistani hospitals. 
“Taliban families live here--in Pakistan, in Rawat, Loi Ber, Bara Kahuh and Tarnol,” Rashid told the Urdu-language network citing the names of Islamabad suburbs.  
“Sometimes their dead bodies arrive and sometimes they come here in hospitals to get medical treatment,” he said.     
Earlier in the month Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in an interview with TOLOnews denied the presence of Taliban sanctuaries in Pakistan, saying most of the group's leaders “are in Afghanistan” and when asked about the presence of Quetta and Peshawar Shuras, or councils, he denied the existence of such institutions in Pakistan and said he “has been hearing of these terms for now decades.” 
Asked whether Taliban are ""funded here in Pakistan,"" Qureshi said: “These are very--those many things that have been going on for years. You’re stuck in the old groove. Get of out that groove, please. Get out of that groove. Now, listen, if you remain stuck in this, believe me, you will not be able to travel far. And we want you to travel far. We want reconciliation and peace.” 
Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan in an op-ed published by The Washington Post said that his country opposes any military takeover of Afghanistan and that “the Taliban cannot win over the whole of the country, and yet must be included in any government for it to succeed.”  
The Taliban has intensified its attacks on Afghan forces over the last two months following US President Joe Biden's announcement of the withdrawal of American forces from the country by September 11.  
At least 50 districts have either fallen to the Taliban or remained contested in the last two months. Many of those captured areas were taken by the Taliban who faced no resistance by security forces. Sources told TOLOnews that many districts fell due to delays in reinforcements. 
On Friday, June 25, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan said that his country will not take military action against the Taliban if the group takes over Afghanistan by force. However, quoted in an article by The New York Times, Khan said that “Pakistan will only recognize a government which is chosen by the people of Afghanistan, whichever government they choose.” 
“Let me assure you, we will do everything except use military action against the Taliban,” Khan replied when asked what Pakistan would do if the Taliban took over Afghanistan by force. “I mean, we will do everything up to that. All sections of our society have decided that Pakistan will take no military action.” 
“Now, we are fencing it, and almost 90 percent of the border, we’ve fenced now,” Khan said. “What if [the] Taliban try to take over Afghanistan through [the] military? Then we will seal the border because now we can, because we have fenced our border, which was previously [open], because Pakistan does not want to get into, number one, conflict, secondly, we do not want another influx of refugees.” 
Khan said that after the US withdrawal, he wished that Pakistan and the US could fix their “lopsided” equation of the past.

Watchdogs Condemn Violations of Rules of War in Afghan Conflict
","
A watchdog on Monday reacted to two recent incidents that involve the mistreatment of remains of soldiers and fighters on battlefields in two Afghan districts, saying such incidents are a violation of the rules of war and must be prevented.
Footage released on social media this month showed 23 members of a special forces unit being shot by the Taliban in Faryab province after they were captured by the group. Other footage from this month shows a number of army forces mistreating bodies of Taliban fighters in Ghazni province. 
Amnesty International called on both sides of the war in Afghanistan to prevent such incidents.
“We call on them to follow the laws of war and to avoid violating international humanitarian law,” said Zaman Sultani, a researcher at Amnesty International.
The Human Rights Organization meanwhile asked the Afghan government to bring cases to an impartial international organization so that perpetrators of war crimes receive justice.
“The committees on both sides of the war have not managed their fighting. It means that they don’t have the punishment and rewards culture in their war management,” said Lal Gul Lal, head of the organization.
“It requires an appeal for justice because members of the human rights council of the United Nations should vote in this respect,” said Zabihullah Farhang, head of the media office of Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission.
A lawmaker meanwhile said that government forces should not violate the rule of war.
“It affects the assistance of the international community, and it affects the image of the Afghan government. It can even be condemned at the UN,” said Abdul Rauf Inami, an MP.
The Ministry of Defense said that any incident in which the rules of war are broken will be investigated.
“The implementation of the country’s laws, laws of war, human rights and international norms are a top priority,” Defense Ministry spokesman Rohullah Ahmadzai said. “Anything that has happened will be investigated thoroughly and perpetrators will be treated based on the law.”

Government figures show that 8,000 families were displaced in Baghlan in the last three weeks, leaving many of them stranded on the streets of the northern city of Pul-e-Khumri while others live in close quarters with dozens in a single home.
In one instance, 17 families are living in one home, said TOLOnews reporter Sharif Amiri.
There are many houses on the outskirts of Pul-e-Khumri – in Band-e-Do area for instance – that have been destroyed in the fight between the government forces and the Taliban.
Many homes that have been evacuated are looked after by at least one member of each family.
Saifuddin, a resident of Pul-e-Khumri, said he looks after their home and has sent other family members to a safer place, but he added that his home has been severely damaged in the clashes.
“My 1,350 dollars and 280,000 afghanis were burned. I came here to get the bag… but it was burned,” Saifuddin said. His two-story building, made of concrete in a common fashion favored by many Afghans, has been damaged and many parts of his house have been damaged, including assets within the building.
The displaced people have been seen everywhere in the central parts of Pul-e-Khumri city for the last three weeks. They are searching for safer places to live.
“The clashes erupted. We left. We could not take anything with us,” said Mohammad Akbar, a displaced person.
“Unfortunately, 8,000 families have been displaced. We helped 1,500 families,” said Sharifullah Shafaq, the head of the Refugees and Repatriation Directorate in Baghlan.

Acting Defense Minister Gen. Bismillah Mohammadi on Monday assured his forces on the battlefield in the central province of Maidan Wardak that the Taliban cannot win through their military campaign and reiterated that war is not the solution to ensure peace in the country. 
Mohammadi visited the volatile province of Maidan Wardak on Monday where he said that now the people, too, are ready to fight against the Taliban in support of the security and defense forces. 
“War is not the solution,” he said. “If it was a solution, it would have shown its results in the last 20 years.”
He added: “Therefore if they (Taliban) want to win militarily and impose violence on the people of Afghanistan, they would take this dream to the grave. They should realize that it is not possible through violence.”
Parwan, Maidan Wardak, Logar and Laghman are the four neighboring provinces of Kabul where some districts have fallen to the Taliban in the last two months. But operations have been launched to retake these areas from the group.
“It would be a bitter experience for the Talibs if they want to repeat their past once again,” Maidan Wardak governor Lawang Faizan said.
Taliban offensives intensified after the announcement of the withdrawal of US and coalition forces in April. Figures collected by TOLOnews show that over 100 districts have fallen to the Taliban in the last two months. 11 districts have been retaken by security forces.
The fall of districts in Kabul’s neighboring provinces has created concerns among residents of the capital city, but security forces on the frontlines pledged that they will continue their efforts to push back Taliban attacks in those areas.
In Parwan province in the north of Kabul, a group of public uprising forces has joined the security forces on the frontlines in the Dara-e-Ghorband area to prevent the Taliban from reaching the city of Charikar that lies 60 kilometers to the north of Kabul.
The public uprising forces said they will defend against threats to Parwan and Kabul.
“The Taliban will not succeed in imposing anything on us. This would be a dream for them,” said Dost Mohammad, a public uprising forces member.
“If they have a bit of love for this country, they should not bow to the demands of strangers,” said Fayiz Sayidkhili, a commander of public uprising forces in Parwan.

No Military Solution to Afghan Crisis: Uzbek Foreign Minister
","
Uzbekistan Foreign Minister Aziz Kamilov said there is no military solution to the Afghan conflict, reiterating that the Taliban must sit down for talks with the Afghan government.
“We have different visions here in the region… We must know about the Afghan crisis that there is no military solution,” Kamilov said in an interview with Dennis Wholey on This is America and the World on June 25.
He said that “Afghanistan must be an integrated part of Central Asia, one single common region.”
“It is necessary to have a regional and international common approach towards the peace process in Afghanistan,” he said.
He said that Uzbekistan supports any format for negotiations, whether they take place in Doha, Turkey or elsewhere, adding that Uzbekistan was the first country to establish direct contact with the leaders of the Taliban.
“The question is what will be the political system in Afghanistan,” he said, reiterating that Uzbekistan will not accept the return of a government like the Taliban’s in the late 1990s.
“Of course, we cannot accept something which Afghanistan had in the 90s, an Islamic emirate of Afghanistan, but at the same time we think that this problem must be solved on the basis of mutual compromise between the government – the existing government – and between the military opposition, Taliban and others,” he said.
However, he affirmed that Islamic values must be respected.
Kamilov noted that the international community should have both sides reach an agreement on peace.
He emphasized the importance of connectivity in the region and said “our idea is to connect this region through Afghanistan.”
He said that the Taliban is not a terrorist organization outside Afghanistan because the group has no record of terrorist attacks beyond Afghanistan’s borders.
“Sometimes people say the Taliban’s movement is a terrorist organization. Of course, maybe they had some contacts within Afghanistan with different extremist organizations, but at the same time, we cannot give an example of the Taliban over the past 40 years organizing some terrorist attack beyond the national borders of Afghanistan, neither in Central Asia, nor in Europe or somewhere else,” he said. 
He added that he does not see the Taliban as a terrorist organization because the group has signed a peace deal with the United States.

'6,000 Taliban Killed in Past Month': Govt
","
As intense fighting continues in the country, Afghan authorities on Tuesday said that over 6,000 Taliban fighters, including Pakistani nationals, have been killed in fighting with the Afghan National Security and Defense Forces (ANDSF) over the past one month.
Ajmal Omar Shinwari, a spokesman for Afghan forces, on Tuesday said that another 3,400 Taliban fighters were wounded during this period. He said that the Afghan Chief of Army Staff is currently working on a plan that the government forces will use to recapture the territory lost to the Taliban.
Meanwhile, the commander of the Special Operations Corps said the unit's activity has increased by 30 percent following the official start of the withdrawal of foreign forces from the country two months ago.
According to the Afghan government, over the past one month, 6,033 Taliban fighters were killed--among them 33 Pakistani nationals--and 3,485 Taliban fighters were wounded--among them 9 Pakistani nationals.
The Afghan government said the role of the Afghan Air Force (AAF) has been crucial in inflicting a major human toll on the Taliban during this period.
The Taliban, however, has rejected the claims by the Afghan government.
“Our entire force is staying in an emergency position, particularly the commandos and special operation forces,” said Ajmal Omar Shinwari, a spokesman for the ANDSF.
“In the planning and technical fields we confronted some challenges,” added Shinwari.
Afghan security officials said that during the past one month, the ANDSF air force carried out 491 attacks on Taliban positions.
“The Afghan Air Force conducted 491 airstrikes in the past one month, in which they targeted Taliban gatherings in Faryab, Baghlan, Helmand, Maidan Wardak, Nangarhar and Laghman provinces,” said Rohullah Ahmadzai, a spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense.
The Afghan Air Force currently has 160 aircraft, 20 of which are Russian-made.
50 are Black Hawk helicopters, four are C130s, and 26 are Mi-17 helicopters.
“In the past, the need for airstrikes was around 20 to 30 percent, but in the past two months the percentage has increased to 70 to 80 percent,” said Abdul Fatah Eshaqzai, a commander of the Afghan Air Force.
The Afghan government has said that the US has pledged the delivery of another 45 helicopters and 7 e-29 helicopters to the Afghan army.
Currently, 25 helicopters are abroad for repair.

ANDSF Retakes 3 Districts, Loses 2 in Heavy Fighting
","
As clashes continue between security forces and the Taliban in many parts of the country, the Defense Ministry said it had recently recaptured areas of Kaldar district in Balkh province and Pashtun Kut and Khan Chahar Bagh districts in Faryab province. Operations are underway to retake other districts that are under Taliban control, the MoD said.
It was also reported that the Taliban has captured the center of Kandahar’s Khakriz district and Logar's Baraki Barak district in the last 24 hours.
Fighting is raging between government forces and the Taliban in many provinces of the country, and the escalation of fighting around the provincial capitals of Ghazni, Kunduz, Baghlan, Takhar, Faryab, and Maidan Wardak provinces is causing alarm among residents and members of Parliament.
Clashes between government forces and the Taliban have been ongoing for several weeks in many parts of the center of Kunduz province and the fighting has displaced hundreds of families.
“The Taliban are on one side of the war and the government is the other side. We do not know where to take shelter,” said Zarmeena, a Kunduz resident displaced by the fighting. “We do not have electricity, food or water,” she said.
Gol Mohammad, another displaced person in Kunduz, said: “Everything has become tougher for us, we do not have food or water.”
Kunduz MPs are calling for serious action to repel Taliban attacks in Kunduz and to address the problems of the displaced people.
“Clashes are going on inside Kunduz city. If serious and timely actions are not taken, I assure you that the Kunduz city, for the third time, will get closer to the brink of collapse,” said Nilofar Jalali Kofi, an MP from Kunduz.
Meanwhile, the prolonged fighting in provincial centers Maimana in Faryab, Taluqan in Takhar, Maidan Shahr in Maidan Wardak, and Ghazni city in Ghazni have caused MPs to raise the alarm in Kabul.
Amir Mohammad Khaksar, an MP from Takhar, stated: “Violence has soared in the country, if it continues, I don’t think we will reach a sustainable peace in the country.”
Government forces on the front lines in the Shinwari district of Parwan province say they are attempting to retake lost districts and to expel the Taliban from the province.
“In the next one or two days we will arrive in Seya Gerd district in Ghurband Valley,” said Sharifullah, an army officer in the Shinwari district in Parwan.
Fawad Aman, the Deputy Spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, said: “Advances have been made in Balkh, Takhar, Baghlan, and Kunduz provinces and this will continue in other parts of the country as well.”
Today President Ghani in a video conference with governors and provincial police chiefs called the Taliban attacks a crime against human rights and stressed that military and civilian officials must abide by human rights laws.

Gen. Miller: US Seeks Peace, Will Defend ANDSF
","
The commander of US forces in Afghanistan General Scott Miller said the US will support the Afghan security forces as foreign forces leave the country.
Miller said that the Taliban’s expansion of violence makes it difficult to achieve peace.
He said that the Taliban will not be able to win the war militarily, and should stop the violence.
“Coalition or US air forces are there to support and--when required--defend the Afghan security forces under attack,” said Miller.
In a question about the Taliban’s potential offensive on major Afghan cities and Kabul, Miller said that such a move by the Taliban will not be acceptable to the Afghan people or the international community.
“That is something we shouldn’t see the Taliban trying to do, if in fact we're committed to a political settlement, if we see that type of activity that calls into question all the work that has been done with the intra-Afghan discussions down in Doha and certainly with the international community desires as we go forward,” said Miller. 
“Military takeover is not in the interest of anyone, certainly not for the people of Afghanistan. Today we have the ability--in accordance with the US-Taliban agreement--and the authority to provide support that is obviously equipment and other maintenance type support--sustainment support--but also the ability to support the Afghan security forces when attacked,” added Miller.
Miller said that financial support and maintenance support are among the commitments that will continue to the Afghan government forces after the foreign troops withdrawal.

US Wants to See Taliban Return to Afghan Peace Process: Pentagon
","
The US Defense Department on Tuesday asked the Taliban to return to the peace negotiations, reminding them that the violence remains too high in Afghanistan.

“I think you saw General Miller speak to that earlier today, concerns over the security situation there,” he added.  
Referring to recent attacks by the Taliban, Kirby said, “We see events on the ground unfold, it certainly calls into question the sincerity of their efforts to be a legitimate, credible participant in the peace process.”  
“That's really the right future for Afghanistan as a political process that leads to a negotiated settlement and a peaceful end to the fighting in Afghanistan. And that's what we're in favor of. That's what the administration's policy continues to try to pursue,” Kirby said.  
He said that once the withdrawal is complete, they will have will have two new mission sets at the Department of Defense: “One is to have a presence in Kabul that is sufficient to the task of protecting our diplomacy there. And two, to have a relationship with Afghanistan, a new bilateral relationship with Afghan forces that is designed to help continue their needs for competency and capability in the field.  
But he reiterated that this support – to Afghan forces – will be over the horizon, over the horizon logistical support and some financial support.  
He also said that the removal of US combat forces, which is what the retrograde is all about, ends the combat mission in Afghanistan for the United States.

Afghanistan’s Survival in Jeopardy: Abdullah
","
Abdullah Abdullah, chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation (HCNR), at the council’s leadership committee meeting at the Presidential Palace on Wednesday said that “the survival of Afghanistan is in danger.” 
The sixth leadership committee meeting of the HCNR was held at the Presidential Palace and was attended by President Ashraf Ghani, HCNR members and other government officials. 
“The truth is, today the survival, security and unity of Afghanistan is in danger.” Abdullah said. “There is no better way than peace.” 
“With the withdrawal of foreign troops from the country, the war has escalated. Unfortunately, the Taliban side has taken advantage of this, and the foreign troop withdrawal has naturally left a vacuum in some areas,” said Abdullah. 
In April, US President Joe Biden announced that the US troops would leave Afghanistan by September 11. 
“Although teams from both sides are in Doha and in contact, we have not witnessed any progress,"" Abdullah said. “They (the Taliban) take very slow steps in the peace talks but have increased the war on the battlefield.” 
“Unfortunately, the Taliban wasted time in the peace process over the months, and there was concern among the people that the Taliban had no intention or will to seek peace. This concern is now growing day by day,” he said. 
“The truth we are facing is the escalation of the war. In today’s meeting, I cannot see anyone that says we must continue the war and the way out is war.” 
This comes as Germany’s last troops left Afghanistan on Tuesday after nearly 20 years of deployment in the country, said the German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer.  
The German defense minister said in a tweet that the last Bundeswehr soldiers “left Afghanistan safely” on Tuesday evening.    
NATO agreed in April to withdraw at least 7,000 of its troops from Afghanistan.

“We must consider the situation of the people of the nation and the situation that they are facing at the moment,"" Abdullah said. “Creating unity among the people in support of peace and defending the system and defending their rights… those people who are affected by war and have the right to live in their own homes.” 
“We want peace from the bottom of the heart ... but we are in a situation where we are saying peace and they are (Taliban) nearing the capital of Afghanistan,” he said. 
He also urged politicians to support the Afghan security forces.  
“At this stage and as citizens, we must forget our titles and show we are accountable to those who have an eye on us and are saying that these people (politicians) have reached this level with our support, what are they doing now for us and what message do they have for the people of Afghanistan and what are they doing to rescue us?""
“This is the time and our responsibility,” he said.  
He also mentioned that if the Taliban miscalculate that they can win militarily, then it will cause the “continuation of the war.” 
“This will be a mistake if any side thinks they can win militarily,"" he noted. “No regional country will benefit by the continuation of the war in the country.” 
“Those countries who were not happy with the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan, today they are facing another truth,” Abdullah said. “As are our neighbors, we are always seeking friendly relations. 
“These countries also don’t want war to continue in Afghanistan: 'God forbid, it will cause these people to be displaced and the growth of terrorism,'"" he said. 
There is an opportunity that the neighboring countries support Afghanistan in reach to lasting peace.  
Speaking of the recent Washington trip, Abdullah said: “The United States's message was even though we are withdrawing our troops, we are supporting the people of Afghanistan and we are with them.” 
He further said: “The US said that we want peace and we also know the obstacles and the issues that have been created against peace…. But the people’s consensus will help us support you.”

AP: Most European Troops Leaving Afghanistan Quietly
","
Most of the European troops have already pulled out of Afghanistan, quietly withdrawing months before the US-led mission was officially expected to end, AP reported. 
On Wednesday, Germany and Italy declared their missions in Afghanistan over and Poland’s last troops returned home, bringing their deployments to a low-key end nearly 20 years after the first Western soldiers were deployed there. 
Announcements from several countries analyzed by the AP show that a majority of European troops has now left with little ceremony — a stark contrast to the dramatic and public show of force and unity when NATO allies lined up to back the US invasion to rid the country of al-Qaida after the Sept. 11,  2001, attacks. 
In April, US President Joe Biden announced that the US troops would leave Afghanistan by September 11.  
In the ensuing decades, the war went from one mission to another. Former US President George W. Bush’s administration shied away from nation-building and the United Nations advocated a light footprint. But with the passing years, NATO and US troops took on greater roles developing Afghanistan’s National Security and Defense Forces and training police. At the war’s peak, the US and NATO military numbers surpassed 150,000. 
NATO agreed in April to withdraw its roughly 7,000 non-American forces from Afghanistan to match Biden’s decision to pull all American troops from the country, starting May 1. 
The US has refused to give troop figures, but when Biden announced the final pullout, between 2,500 and 3,500 troops were deployed. As of February, a total of some 832,000 American troops had served in Afghanistan, while about 25,100 Defense Department civilians had also served there. 
The US has also refused to give a clear date for a final withdrawal. 
On Tuesday, the US Defense Department called on the Taliban to return to the peace negotiations, reminding them that the violence remains too high in Afghanistan.  
“What we want to see, what we'd like to see is the Taliban return to the peace process in a credible way,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said at a press briefing on Tuesday. “The violence remains too high, and we’re all aware of all of the security situation in Afghanistan.”

Pakistan Can Be US's Partner in Afghan Peace, Not Conflict: Khan
","
Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday said that Pakistan could be ""partners with the United States in peace but never in conflict"" in Afghanistan, Pakistan’s Dawn news reported. 
During a speech in Pakistan's national assembly, he also criticized past policies that led to Pakistan's joining the US intervention in Afghanistan. 
""When we gave so many services, did they (US) praise us or acknowledge our sacrifices? Instead, they called us a hypocrite and blamed us. Instead of appreciating us, Pakistan was bad-mouthed,” he said quoted by Dawn news. 
He mentioned that had never felt more ""insulted"" than when Pakistan decided to join the United States's war on terror.  
""We decided to become a front line state for the American war on terror. I questioned repeatedly, what did we have to do with the war?” he asked. 
Khan said he wanted the nation to remember that period forever and the ""idiocy"" of the policies at the time. 
""Does any country get involved in another's [war] and lose 70,000 lives?"" he asked. ""What they (US) said, we kept doing. [Former president Pervez] Musharraf said in his book that he took money and sent people to Guantanamo.""
""The matter did not stop there, they (US) ordered us to send our army to tribal areas. We sent our army to tribal areas. They were our people. What was the result of that?"" he questioned. ""I was called Taliban Khan when I said this was wrong."" 
The premier termed it the ""darkest period of our history"" when Pakistan was not sure who was its ally. ""Have you heard of a friendly country carrying out attacks and drone strikes in your country?"" he asked. 
""A terrorist is sitting in London since 30 years. Will they give us permission to attack him?"" he questioned in an apparent reference to Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) founder Altaf Hussain. 
""If they will not give permission then why did we? Are we subhuman or half human or do our lives not have enough value?"" he asked.

Announcements from several countries analyzed by the AP show that a majority of European troops has now left with little ceremony — a stark contrast to the dramatic and public show of force and unity when NATO allies lined up to back the US invasion to rid the country of al-Qaida after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. 
On Wednesday, the US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin during a meeting with his German counterpart at the Pentagon pledged to work with Germany towards ""lasting peace and stability"" in Afghanistan on Wednesday (June 30), as he hosted his German counterpart at the Pentagon. 
“For decades American and German service members have stood shoulder to shoulder against common threats and to advance our shared interests and values.” Lloyd Austin. “Now we saw this over almost 20 years in Afghanistan where Germany was a framework nation. And as we wind down our mission there, we reflect on our shared sacrifice, including brother German and American soldiers who have paid the ultimate price.”

","
Security forces have made advances with clearing operations in Pul-e-Khumri, the capital of Baghlan province, on Wednesday night, Afghan commandos said on Thursday. 
The security forces have cleared about 3 km in the Bolakha and Band-e-Mazar areas in Pul-e-Khumri and also retaken five security outposts that had fallen to the Taliban, according to the commandos.
 
TOLOnews reporter Sharif Amiry, who is in Baghlan, said the Taliban has left some parts of the areas where clashes with the security forces took place.
Several civilians’ houses and shops have been damaged in Bolakha and Band-e-Mazar areas due to ongoing clashes on Wednesday night, Amiry said, adding that the commandos launched the operation at midnight to push back the Taliban. 


 



Footage shows some shops and houses were still damaged from Wednesday night’s clashes. 
Before the operation, the Taliban tried to break through the the defenses of the security forces and enter Pul-e-Khumri center from Bolakha and Band-e-Mazar areas, members of the local forces said. 
“We have retaken a 3 to 4 km area from the Taliban,” said Sediqullah Muradi, a commander of commando forces. 
Parwiz Saydkheil, a security force member, said: “Forces have redeployed in those areas that were retaken.” 
Imam Ali, a commando officer, said that in the past six months he has not visited his home, and he was wounded in his head four months ago.
“I will continue the battle as long as I am alive. I don’t have any fear,” he said.

Poppy Cultivation Up 45 Percent in Afghanistan: Ministry
","
The deputy minister of counter-narcotics on Thursday said that poppy cultivation and drug smuggling has increased by 45 percent in Afghanistan this year compared to the same period last year.
Authorities in Afghanistan said that poppy is currently cultivated on over 200,000 hectares of land in different regions of the country and that Afghanistan still produces 80 percent of the world's opium.
Meanwhile, the deputy ministry of interior on Thursday burned 67 metric tons of drugs in Kabul.
“We burned some heroin, morphine, poppy, hashish and alcohol that is used in the production of heroin,” said Wahidullah Kalimzai, deputy minister of counter narcotics.
“The structure of the commando forces must be expanded so that we are able to prevent smuggling by air and ground monitoring,” said Hashem Alokozai, a senator.
There are thousands of drug addicts currently on the streets.
Ali is an addict who has been using the drug for the past 20 years.
“They are not treating it in the right way, they just keep us there for a specific period of time,” said Ali, referring to treatment programs for addicts.
The Afghan Ministry of Public Health said that currently there are around 3.5 million addicts in Afghanistan.
“The difference in the numbers between 2009 and 2016—900,000 in 2009 and 3.5 million now--indicates a rising trend,” said Zahir Sultani, the head of Ibn-e-Sina hospital.
Over the past two decades, the US allocated $8 billion to counter the drug problem in Afghanistan.

June Deadliest Month in Afghanistan in Two Decades
","
Afghan authorities claim that the Afghan National Security and Defense Forces (ANDSF) have killed over 6,000 Taliban fighters in approximately one month, and the Taliban has said that the group has also inflicted major casualties on government forces.
During this period the government also evacuated 120 districts following offensives by the Taliban.
In the latest development, the Taliban has captured the center of Tagab district in the northern province of Kapisa.
Numbers gathered by TOLOnews show that 638 military personnel and civilians were also killed in Taliban attacks during this period and 1,060 others were wounded.
“The main reason for the collapse of the districts is poor leadership at the leadership level of the security and defense forces,” said MP Khan Agha Rezayee.
Based on the figures, although the number of targeted attacks and explosions decreased during this period, the level of casualties among the security personnel and civilians continued to rise.
The majority of casualties were reported in Baghlan, Faryab, Badakhshan, Ghazni, Takhar, Balkh, Ghor, Herat, Farah, Kunduz, Badghis and Sar-e-Pul provinces.
“The lines (personnel) of the war changed, people were serving in the provinces as security commanders who weren’t familiar with the war because the government had sent the war commanders home,” said MP Ibdallullah Mohammadi.
“There was no preparation to confront such a big war, we weren’t prepared for guerrilla warfare,” said MP Arif Rahmani.
Meanwhile, Afghanistan’s Ministry of Defense (MoD) said that the Afghan security forces have increased airstrikes on Taliban positions in Nangarhar, Herat, Balkh, Jawzjan, Helmand, Takhar, Badakhshan, Kunduz, Baghlan and Kapisa provinces in a move to recapture the districts lost to the Taliban.
“258 Taliban fighters were killed and 100 more were wounded in the operations conducted by the security and defense forces in the past 24 hours,” said Fawad Aman, deputy spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.
Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan in reference to a possible worsening of the situation in Afghanistan said that Pakistan will face a difficult time in view of the potential impact of Afghanistan at war. He said that Pakistan has no influence on the Taliban.
During a speech in Pakistan's national assembly, he also criticized past policies that led to Pakistan's joining the US intervention in Afghanistan.
""When we gave so many services, did they (US) praise us or acknowledge our sacrifices? Instead, they called us a hypocrite and blamed us. Instead of appreciating us, Pakistan was bad-mouthed,” he said quoted by Dawn news.
He mentioned that had never felt more ""insulted"" than when Pakistan decided to join the United States's war on terror. 
""We decided to become a front-line state for the American war on terror. I questioned repeatedly, what did we have to do with the war?” he asked.
Khan said he wanted the nation to remember that period forever and the ""idiocy"" of the policies at the time.
""Does any country get involved in another's (war) and lose 70,000 lives?"" Khan asked. ""What they (US) said, we kept doing. (Former president Pervez) Musharraf said in his book that he took money and sent people to Guantanamo.""

Leaders at HCNR Meeting Agree to Defend Political System
","
Afghan political leaders who attended a meeting of the leadership committee of the High Council of National Reconciliation (HCNR) at the Presidential Palace on Wednesday said that all political leaders agreed to defend the political system of the country.
They said there is a need for practical steps to be taken toward creating a national consensus on the national issues and only having meetings will not help ensure the security and safety of the country.
However, the absence of former president Hamid Karzai, Mohammad Karim Khalili, Amrullah Saleh, Mohammad Hanif Atmar and Rahmatullah Nabil in the meeting has raised questions.
Abdullah Abdullah, chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation (HCNR), at the meeting, said that “the survival of Afghanistan is in danger.”
“The truth is, today the survival, security and unity of Afghanistan is in danger,” Abdullah said. “There is no better way than peace.”
“Of course, these meetings bring hope among the people, but these meetings shouldn’t be just symbolic,” said Fareeda Momand, a member of the HCNR.
The sixth leadership committee meeting of the HCNR was held at the Presidential Palace and was attended by President Ashraf Ghani, HCNR members and other government officials.
15 members spoke at the meeting. President Ghani left the meeting early because he was scheduled to meet a foreign guest.
“Mr. Karzai was very busy yesterday, he had meetings with members of parliament including Mr. Khalili. Any meeting that takes place should yield a result as expected by the people,” said Shahzada Massoud, adviser to Karzai.
Although a six-member delegation comprised of former president Hamid Karzai and HCNR chief Abdullah was expected to travel to Doha following the Ghani-led trip to the US, sources have said that no discussion was held about the trip in the meeting on Wednesday.
In April, US President Joe Biden announced that the US troops would leave Afghanistan by September 11.
This comes as Germany’s last troops left Afghanistan on Tuesday after nearly 20 years of deployment in the country, said the German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. 
The German defense minister said in a tweet that the last Bundeswehr soldiers “left Afghanistan safely” on Tuesday evening.  
NATO agreed in April to withdraw at least 7,000 of its troops from Afghanistan. 
At the time, Germany had around 1,100 troops in Afghanistan.

A mortar round landed inside the residence of Atta Mohammad Noor, the former governor of Balkh province this evening, wounding at least two people, said MP Sayed Zahir Masroor.  
""The mortar landed while Noor was in a meeting with political leaders, provincial council members and security officials to review the security situation of the province,"" he said.  
Security sources said that the mortar hit a vehicle that belonged to Ali Mohaqiq, MP and son of Mohammad Mohaqiq, senior adviser on political and security affairs of the president. 
“A driver of Ali Mohaqiq and another person were wounded in the incident,” according to the sources, who added that “no one at the meeting was hurt in the attack.” 
Noor went to Balkh last week to support local security forces in clearing operations against the Taliban. 
Out of 14 districts in Balkh, nine of them have fallen to the Taliban in the past several weeks. Kaldar and Chahar Boak were the districts that fell most recently.
The Taliban were a threat to Mazar-e-Sharif, the capital of the province, but security forces and commandos reinforced security to prevent the Taliban, said sources.
A week ago Noor pledged to mobilize the public in Balkh against the Taliban and to clear the province and restore stability. 
“God forbid, the fall of Balkh means the fall of the north and the fall of the north means the fall of Afghanistan. We have experienced this. It is not a story, it is history,” Noor said. “We will not allow it to fall. We are here with a firm commitment to return security to the people, and we will not leave them alone.”  
No group has claimed responsibility for the mortar attack.

‘Hundreds’ of Troops Deployed to Protect Border Town in North
","
As Taliban attacks continue, an army commander in the north said that “hundreds of troops” have been deployed to protect the Hairatan border town in the northern province of Balkh.
Kaldar district has been contested between the government forces and the Taliban in the last few weeks, something that has threatened trade and transit through Hairatan that shares a border with Uzbekistan.
The forces have been stationed at bases as close as five kilometers to the east and west of the border town, said Sayed Saadullah Hashemi, the deputy commander of Afghan Army’s 209 Shaheen Corps.
He said that no attack has happened by the Taliban in the last two days.
“Right now, security forces, including commandos, the border forces, the special units have created a security belt within a five kilometers area to protect the border town from all sides,” Hashemi said.
Officials in Hairatan said no truck has entered the border from Uzbekistan in the last two days while normally 250 trucks cross the border to Afghanistan daily.
“The recent wave of insecurity in the north has reduced the traffic at the border town,” said Jamshid Khorasanpoor, head of maintenance and service department of Hairatan.
Residents of the border town said markets are closed and many families have left their homes following the rise of insecurity in Balkh.
“People are worried. One goes to Mazar (the capital of Balkh), while others go to villages,” said Abdul Karim, a resident of Hairatan border town.
“The town is closed. People are scared,” said Fida Mohammad, a resident of Hairatan.
According to local officials, the Taliban has reached as close as five kilometers to Hairatan after capturing Kaldar and Shortepa districts in Balkh. But army commanders assured that they would use all their resources to protect the area.
“We will use all our efforts and resources, especially at the border forces regiment, to defend and protect the area,” said Mohammad Jan Mohammadi, a border forces commander in the north.

Daesh Building Up Forces in Northern Afghanistan: Lavrov
","
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday said that Daesh militants are building up their forces in northern Afghanistan as US and NATO troops are leaving the country, calling it a worry for Moscow.
Quoted in a report by Reuters, Lavrov said Daesh was actively gaining territory in Afghanistan amid the withdrawal and what he described as the “irresponsible” stance taken by officials in Kabul.
“It is also important to pay attention to Afghanistan, where ISIS (Islamic State) is actively concentrating its forces. And they do it using the unforgivably prolonged process of preparing real peace negotiations. And those in the ruling structures of Afghanistan who are trying in every possible way to delay this process even more, of course, should think about the consequences of these actions for their homeland,” Lavrov said as quoted by Reuters.
Lavrov said that Daesh is taking the advantage of the current situation to develop its territories in Afghanistan.
“This worries us because in the conditions of the irresponsible behavior of some officials in Kabul, in the conditions of the rash withdrawal of NATO troops from Afghanistan, which has left not a single possibility to report on the completion of at least some tasks. Under these conditions, ISIS is actively developing territories, primarily in the north of Afghanistan, right on the border with countries that are our allies,” he said as quoted by Reuters.

MoI to Probe Govt Forces Withdrawal from Districts' Centers
","
Afghanistan’s Ministry of Interior Affairs (MoI) will probe recent evacuations by government forces from the centers of various districts across the country.
Over the last two months, the Taliban has taken over dozens of districts across Afghanistan, raising strong criticisms among the public and analysts who are citing poor leadership and mismanagement of the war as key reason that the Taliban has taken over large swaths of land in the country.
Reports say that in some districts as instances in Shireen Tagab and Pashtun Kot and Qaisar districts of Faryab, and Qarabagh and Muqur districts of Ghazni, hundreds of security force members surrendered to the Taliban without any resistance.
“There is speculation that the security forces were asked not to fight, but it is not confirmed who said this,” said MP Khan Agha Rezaee.
In the past two months Taliban has taken control of more than 120 districts.
“Investigation is underway to find out the main reason,” said Gen. Abdul Sattar Mirzakwal, the acting minister of interior.
Referring to the factors behind the evacuations, the Ministry of Defense said that lack of equipment and delay in the delivery of emergency assistance to the security forces are among the factors that have led to the problem.
“We evacuated some areas in order to prevent casualties among civilians and military personnel, and to prevent the damage to residential areas and delay in on time delivery of supplies to our personnel,” said Rohullah Ahmadzai, spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.
Rahmatullah Nabil, the former head of Afghan intelligence agency, said that the Taliban is seeking to takeover some strategic and important areas.
“The Taliban want to expand fighting in central provinces and to take control over the supply routes to Kabul and then go to the negotiating table where they will make major demands, and if their demands not met, they will focus on other objectives they seek,” said Nabil.
Taliban significantly increased their offensive after foreign troops started withdrawal from Afghanistan.

But I am concerned that they deal with the internal issues that they have to be able to generate the kind of support they need nationwide to maintain the government,” he said.

“This is the 10th district that collapses one after another. The local government and the central government have forgotten them and are not paying attention to them,” said Saed Hayatullah, a resident of Faizabad.  
Amidst concerning situation in Faizabad, the police chief of Badakhshan, Khalil-ur-Rahman Jawad is under treatment in Kabul as he has tested positive for COVID-19.   
“What we should do is to mobilize the elders of the ‘resistance region’ and create history for the second time by the second generation of the resistance,” said Nilofar Ibrahimi, an MP from Badakhshan.  
“They are faced with lack of logistics. The Air Force cannot address all areas. This is concerning,” said Sayed Muqaddam Amin, a former military officer.  
Meanwhile, sources from Takhar said that with the fall of Kalafgan and Farkhar districts, only Taluqan city and Worsaj districts have remained under government control in the province.  
“We have 16 administrative units. All collapsed one after another. The security situation in Taluqan is sensitive,” said Abdul Kabir, a resident of Taluqan.  
“People are worried in Taluqan. There are displaced people on Taluqan’s streets and people are in a difficult situation,” said Mohammad Azam Afzali, member of Takhar provincial council. 
But the Ministry of Defense said that 224 Taliban were killed in government forces operations in nine provinces in the last 24 hours. The ministry said that efforts will be made to retake the areas that have fallen to militants.  
“The security and defense forces of Afghanistan will not spare any efforts,” said Fawad Aman, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.  
Taliban attacks have increased after the start of the withdrawal of international troops from Afghanistan. On Friday, the US forces left Bagram Airfield, which was the largest military base for American troops in the country.

Afghan Forces Will Soon Switch to Offensive Stance: Official
","
The Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) will switch their operations to an offensive mode in near future, a top security official said as Taliban has been taking over territories in the last two months. 
Over the last two years, Afghan forces have been on a defensive stance few times. The first time they agreed to be on a defensive mode was in 2019 when the government agreed to avoid offensive operations against the Taliban as part of efforts to move the peace process forward. Last year, defense officials said the security forces are in an “active defensive mode” that allows them to take action against the Taliban whenever they attack a security outpost or a base. 
Talking to TOLOnews on Saturday, Gen. Abdul Sattar Mirzakwal, the acting minister of interior, said the Taliban is seeking to takeover supply routes, but the security forces are planning to thwart such attempts by the group. 
Referring to the fall of districts to the Taliban, Mirzakwal said that war management issues are the main reason behind the ongoing situation.  
He called on all Afghans to mobilize against the Taliban. 
Gen. Mirzakwal, who was appointed to the post last month, said the increase in public uprising forces was effective at this juncture, adding that these forces will be operating within the structure of the National Directorate of Security until the situation gets back to normal. 
 “We are working on the plan to move to offensive status. The centers of the cities will never collapse. Provinces are our red line,” Mirzakwal said. 
Some Kabul residents, meanwhile, said Afghan forces will defend the threats effectively if people join hands together in their support. 
“Regarding Sher Khan border town (in Kunduz), we are working on a plan to retake it from the Taliban,” he said. 
The border town was captured by the Taliban this month, cutting trade and transit to Central Asia. 
“If the Taliban thinks they will win militarily, this is not possible,” said military analyst Dawlat Waziri. 
Mirzakwal concluded that the Afghan government was still in favor of a political settlement of the conflict rather than a military solution.

Russian Envoy Shows Opposition to US Plans for Regional Bases
","
As the US troops are leaving, Russian envoy Zamir Kabulov has said that the United States cannot and should not transform the withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan into the relocation of its military facilities to Central Asia, something that the US is looking into it as an option to provide over-the-horizon support to Afghan forces.
""We have already sent such a signal to Washington at various levels. I hope it will be heard,"" Kabulov said as quoted by Russian news agency, RIA. 
He called on the Afghan government and the Taliban to establish a coalition government. 
Kabulov promised international support in forming an interim government, adding that that ""the final decision on the configuration and parameters of the future power structure should be made by Afghans themselves."" 
The Russian envoy said he expects that a suitable occasion for the start of peace negotiations will come closer to autumn. 
""We continue to work together in the format of an expanded ‘troika’ with the participation of Russia, the United States, China, and Pakistan,” Kabulov said as quoted by RIA. “We do not rule out the convening of its next round in the near future. In addition, we keep in mind the possibility of organizing another meeting of the Moscow format, which, as you know, unites all the countries of the region around Afghanistan, as well as the United States."" 
The withdrawal of US and coalition forces from Afghanistan has created many concerns about the future of the government and the Afghan forces.

Parliament Speaker Attends Meeting on Afghanistan in Tajikistan
","
The speaker of Afghanistan's parliament, Mir Rahman Rahmani, this week has participated at the Council of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Collective Security Organizations on Afghanistan over the security situation in northern provinces, the Council of the Parliamentary Assembly said in a statement.
“Due to the deteriorating security situation near the southern borders of the Republic of Tajikistan, a CSTO Members State, the Council of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Collective Security Treaty Organization: Express its concerns regarding the high level of combat activity in Afghanistan, particularly in its northern provinces, amid the withdrawal of foreign military presence,” the statement said.
It also called on the Afghan government and the Taliban “to cease violence to ensure favorable conditions for advancing the peace processes and establishing Afghanistan as an independent and neutral state.”
The council strongly condemned “terrorist attacks in Afghanistan against civilians and stresses that the activities of Daesh and other international terrorist groups constitute a key instability component in Afghanistan.”
It also expressed concerns regarding “the extremely high level of drug production in Afghanistan, being a major source of income for terrorist groups in Afghanistan, and calls on the authorities of Afghanistan, including the Afghan National Assembly, to increase their efforts to combat this scourge.”
The council called on the international community, including national parliaments and international parliamentary organizations, to increase humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan to prevent Afghan refugees' flow into neighboring countries.
The council has expressed its commitment to support through parliamentary diplomacy the Afghan National Assembly, Afghan ethnic groups, and political forces, including the Taliban to advance the reconciliation process as soon as possible.
The council reaffirmed its readiness to contribute to the improvement and harmonization of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan legislation in combating terrorism and illegal drug trafficking, drawing on the lawmaking experience accumulated by the Assembly, including the developed model laws and recommendations.

Radar, Flight Guidance Systems Operational at Bagram Airfield
","
The Afghan Civil Aviation Authority said that the radar and VSAT communication systems were reactivated at Bagram Airfield two days after US forces left the base and handed it over to Afghanistan’s army.
The authority said that the VSAT system was deactivated ahead of the withdrawal of the Resolute Support forces from the airfield, but it has been reactivated by Afghan engineers. 
The two systems, the authority said, will be used for flight guidance in landings and take-offs at the airfield and at Kabul airport. 
The US military left Bagram Airfield on Friday and handed it over to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces. 
The airfield, located 69 kilometers north of Kabul in the central province of Parwan, saw more than 100,000 US troops pass through its facilities. 
Ahead of the US withdrawal, hundreds of pieces of equipment and vehicles were scrapped by the US military.
Those who purchased the material said the scrap is worth millions of dollars. 
The Afghan government said that the equipment handed over to Afghan forces is worth $1 billion.
Bagram Airfield was the biggest airbase of the US military in Afghanistan over the last 20 years. US forces started withdrawing forces from the country on May 1, a process that is expected to be completed earlier than the given deadline of Sept. 11.

Dozens of Ghor Women Take Up Arms in Support of ANDSF
","
Dozens of women took up arms – some of them heavy weapons – and marched in the capital city of Feroz Koh to pledge their support the Republic and the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces.
The women said that the historical record of the five years of the Taliban regime proved that the group violates women’s rights.
Thousands of people have taken up arms in support of the Afghan forces as the fall of districts to the group continues.
“They are standing by their brothers and are supporting the system, the people, and the country’s sovereignty,” a Ghor resident said.
The exact number of those who have taken up arms against the Taliban is so far not clear. The defense and interior ministries said that these forces will eventually be combined with the local police, NDS local forces, and the local army forces. 
“A situation that will later create bad consequences will not be allowed. They will first support us and then they will be included in the police, army or the local NDS forces,” the acting minister of interior Gen. Abdul Sattar Mirzakwal said.
Atta Mohammad Noor, who leads a public mobilization movement in Balkh and has gone to Balkh districts to fight the Taliban, criticized some government officials for not cooperating with them in their campaign against the group.
“We hear some words from some sides asking why have they gone to the war? They should stay in the city and hand over the war to us. My brother, you are losing the war,” Noor said.
Meanwhile, the office of Ahmad Massoud, a public figure and son of the national hero Ahmad Shah Massoud, said that former mujahideen leaders are making efforts to reorganize a new front against the Taliban by consulting political leaders from the former resistance front.
“We hope that this front is announced and the public uprising forces become organized,” said Saleh Mohammad Registani, a member of Ahmad Massoud’s political office.
There are questions about the achievements of the public uprising forces, but representatives of these forces said they have succeeded in preventing the fall of their towns to the Taliban.
“They have proved effective in defending the security belts on the outskirts of Kunduz city,” said Rabbani Rabbani, a member of the Kunduz provincial council.
“So far, we have not seen proper support by the government for the people,” said Abdul Basir Osmani, an MP from Badghis.

","
Sources said on Sunday that the centers of nine more districts were captured by the Taliban in the last 24 hours – six districts in Badakhshan, one in Kandahar, one in Paktika and one in Takhar.
The districts include Kofab, Argo, Kohistan, Zibak, Yawan and Baharak in Badakhshan, Panjwai in Kandahar, Zerok in Paktika and Worsaj in Takhar. They all fell to the Taliban between Saturday evening and Sunday evening. 
“The operations we had in the last 24 hours were in Laghman, Nijrab district in Kapisa and Shinwari in Parwan, and in Ghazni--where we inflicted casualties on the enemy,” said Maj. Gen. Hibatullah Alizai, the commander of the Special Forces Corps. 
The Army’s 217 Pamir Corps said the Taliban suffered casualties in Afghan forces operations in Baharak district in Badakhshan.
“The enemy sustained 30 to 40 casualties in Baharak,” commander of the corps, Abbas Tawakuli said.
In Badakhshan, 17 districts fell to the Taliban in the last few days. Some Tajik media outlets have reported that at least 300 members of the Afghan military have gone to Tajikistan through border towns.
However, officials in Badakhshan pledged to ensure the security of the capital city, Faizabad, and on Sunday the MoD said commando forces had been deployed to Faizabad.
“We are monitoring the security situation. We feel your concerns. We will serve you until the last drop of our blood,” said Badakhshan governor Ahmad Bashir Samim.
In Takhar province, which neighbors Badakhshan, the residents said all districts have fallen to the Taliban except Taluqan, the capital city.
“The city of Taluqan has been under siege by the Taliban for the last two weeks. The central government has paid no attention,” said Najibullah, a Takhar resident.
“We witness the Takhar youth martyred every day,” said Hasibullah, a Takhar resident.
Meanwhile, on Saturday, a day after the withdrawal of the US military from Bagram Airfield, a group of 20 Taliban fighters attacked a border police outpost at Zhala village between Bagram and Koh-e-Safi districts in Parwan, but local officials said the attack was pushed back by security forces.
“The security and defense forces and the public forces led by Gen. Abdul Raziq caused a major defeat for the enemy and inflicted casualties on them,” said Parwan governor Fazluddin Ayar.
Two Taliban attacks, one on Sarubi district in Kabul and the Dasht-e-Tob area in Sayed Abad district of Maidan Wardak, are two other security incidents in the last 24 hours.

ANDSF Braces for Attacks on Major Cities, Highways, Border Areas

Maj. Gen. Hibatullah Alizai, the commander of the Special Operations Corps, said that suppressing the Taliban is the top priority of the forces and that ""strong belts"" have been created for the protection of big cities, highways and border towns.
Alizai said there was a vast presence of Pakistani Taliban, especially Punjabis, in recent attacks by the Taliban, and that “hundreds” of Taliban fighters have been killed in Afghan forces operations.
He stressed the need to retake the districts that have fallen to the Taliban.
He said that political, regional and social issues are behind the evacuation of dozens of districts by Afghan forces. He added that the issue will be investigated.
The general said that the Taliban wants to attack major cities but the Afghan forces are ready to thwart such plans.
“Our main goal is to inflict as many casualties on the enemy as possible. Besides that, our goal is to protect major cities, highways and key border towns that are important for our major cities and the country,” he said.
Alizai, who returned from operations in Ghazni and Laghman on Saturday evening, said that foreign Taliban and al Qaeda fighters have a presence among the Taliban.
“Pakistani Taliban are mostly seen these days and those Taliban who belong to Punjab and those who even have Pakistan arm ID cards. The number of Afghan Taliban is dwindling,” he said.
He added that at least 10,000 members of commando forces are engaged in suppressing the Taliban across the country and that their number will increase over time.
However, there is criticism over how security in the country has been handled:
“If they had paid attention to the provinces, we would not be in the situation that we are today,” said Daud Ghafoori, a Senator.
In the last two months, at least 120 districts have fallen to the Taliban, mostly in northern and northeastern Afghanistan.

UK May Keep Special Forces in Afghanistan: Media
","
The British government is poised to keep a small special forces contingent on the ground in Afghanistan, The Telegraph has reported. 
This comes as the US and its NATO allies pulled out of the coalition's main base in Bagram district of Parwan province on Friday. 
The UK is now reportedly considering the retention of an “advisory group” of elite special forces soldiers in the country, the report said. 
Citing a former Special Air Service (SAS) soldier, who until recently was stationed in Afghanistan, The Telegraph reported that the group would “provide training to Afghan units and deploy with them on the ground as advisers.”  
The deployment will be open-ended, they said, meaning the forces would stay “as long as [the government] continue to see value” in having them stationed there. 
The decision whether to withdraw all the UK’s remaining 750 soldiers from Afghanistan for good or leave some troops behind amid the Taliban’s ongoing offensive is yet to be made, a senior military source told the paper.  
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has the final say on the matter, is expected to make an announcement at the National Security Council meeting on Monday. 
Earlier reports in the UK media suggested that British troops might exit Afghanistan by July 4.
Officials in the UK, however, did not commit to a certain timeframe, saying that London “reserves the right” to dispatch troops back to Afghanistan, either as part of a coalition or unilaterally, if parts of the country are overrun by terrorists, the report added. 
In the meantime, the former head of the British Secret Intelligence Service, MI6, said the potential for extremist groups to be able to regenerate in Afghanistan as US and British troops leave the territory would pose an international threat.
Alex Younger told Sky News that if such groups were allowed to regenerate in Afghanistan following the departure of the international forces, ""it will lead to more threat on the shores of our country and our allies.""
Lord Richard Dannatt, the former Chief of the General Staff from 2006 to 2009 said Britain's mistake had been to allow itself to be diverted into Iraq in 2003 instead of investing in the future of Afghanistan.
""This is generally going to be a civil war, an internal struggle, and it's up to the Afghan people to decide do they want to go back under the Taliban or do they want to live that better life that we've shown them glimpses of,"" he told Sky News on Monday.

US Attempts to Soften Afghan Pullout: NY Times
","
The New York Times on Sunday wrote that US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin in a meeting with the current commander of US and NATO forces Gen. Austin Miller, Joint Chiefs Chaiman Gen. Mark A. Milley and Centcom head Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. discussed Afghanistan and specifically ways to buffer the impact of the US pullout on the Afghan people. 
On Friday, the US military left Bagram Airbase in Parwan province, north of Kabul, effectively ending US operations, although a contingent of US military personnel have been left behind to guard the US embassy. 
Austin ordered a series of steps to slow the pace of the final withdrawal from America’s longest war, said The New York Times. 
The measures are intended to buy some time to soften the drawdown’s psychological shock to the Afghans, and to extend at least through August some involvement by the American military, despite there being no combat troops, equipment or bases in the country. 
The first measure, said The Times report, sought to highlight Biden’s message to Afghan leaders that the United States was not abandoning the country at a moment when intelligence analysts predict the fall of the Afghan government to the Taliban in months.
General Miller will remain in Afghanistan for “at least a couple more weeks,” said John F. Kirby, Pentagon spokesman, to aid the transition of the American military mission from warfighting to two new objectives — protecting an ongoing US diplomatic presence in Kabul and maintaining ties with the Afghan military. 
The Times quoted Pentagon officials saying that Gen. Miller will turn over his command to Gen. McKenzie who will assume ""at least through August"" the same authorities General Miller had to carry out airstrikes against Al Qaeda, the Daesh and, in very limited circumstances, Taliban fighters.
General McKenzie will be authorized, at least through the September deadline, to move 300 additional troops into Afghanistan if needed for security or emergencies, like the possible evacuation of the American Embassy, Pentagon officials said as cited by The Times.
The Times said that in the next few weeks, Gen. Miller will travel within Afghanistan, and to Brussels to brief NATO officials on the transition, and to the forward headquarters in Qatar, Pentagon officials said.

Afghan Youth Still Hopeful Despite Concerns for Future

The generation that grew up in the last 20 years in Afghanistan was an exception given its greater access to opportunity and decreased challenges compared to past generations.
Some of these youth --aged 20 to 25--said they were provided good educational opportunities, but they would have made much more progress if the challenges over the last few years did not exist. 
Mina Haidari, 20, said she grew up at the start of the US and NATO’s military presence in Afghanistan, an era that provided vast opportunities for girls, especially for their education. 
Haidari, who is in her second year at university, works as a librarian at a cultural center in Kabul. She says that so far she has not seen any limitations in her activities, but she has heard from elders of her family that women were faced with many hardships in the past, especially in the 1990s. 
“Right now, we are in a society where a family feels proud when someone, especially a woman, gets an education, makes her future and becomes an effective person in society,” Haidari said. 
But amid many concerns following the start of the withdrawal of US and coalition forces, the Afghan youth said they are optimistic about the future and insist that peace is the only way forward and the only solution to the conflict. 
“We can achieve more for the country if the situation improves a bit or remains as it is right now,” said Jafar Tabish, a Kabul resident. 
“We felt calm, we had no tension, and were focused on our education. We succeeded to complete our education,” said Husain Haidari, a Kabul resident. 
Many youth in Afghanistan have achieved key roles in the government and private institutions over the last two decades. Their role in media, parliament and provincial councils has been steady during this time.

MPs Accuse Acting Finance Minister of Corruption in Customs
","
Lawmakers in the Wolesi Jirga, the Lower House of Parliament, on Monday accused the acting finance minister Khalid Payinda of selling positions in customs directorates for millions of dollars and for making illegal appointments and removals after he refused to appear at Parliament to respond to the allegations.
The acting minister was supposed to brief the MPs about his recent comments on the embezzlement of millions of dollars a day from the country’s customs. But he did not appear.
“Vacancies are sold. The finance minister himself is involved in this issue,” said Hamida Ahmadzai, an MP.
“Shame to such a minister in whose presence $8.5 million is embezzled,” said Shahpoor Popal, an MP from Herat.
Another lawmaker, Alim Saee, who represents Takhar province, said the signature of the acting ministers, including Khalid Payinda, who have completed their tenure as caretakers, should be announced invalid “starting from today.”
“The signature of his corrupt person is not valid from today,” he said.
Two months ago, Payinda told lawmakers at a general session that some MPs have influence on customs where $8.5 million is embezzled every day.
“Soldiers die due to lack of supplies, but they embezzle millions of dollars daily,” said Jawed Safi, an MP and member of the budget and finance committee of the Parliament.
Other lawmakers meanwhile accused some of their colleagues of making deals with the finance ministry and called to send Payinda to the judicial institutions.
“The treasury director of the government leader in a democratic country is not responsive to the nation and based on the Constitution, he has no place here and he should be sent to the judiciaries as quickly as possible,” said Nahid Farid, an MP from Herat.
“The minister is threatened that if he does not do their work, he will be summoned. I am sure that a big number here have made deals with him,” said Belqis Roshan, an MP from Farah.
The acting finance minister so far has not made public the list of those who he claimed are involved in major corruption in customs despite his vow to do so in May.
“Considering the current situation with the country’s customs and other income resources, he (the acting minister) could not appear at the House, but we confirm that he will appear in future sessions if he is asked,” Finance Ministry spokesman Rafi Tabi said.
The lawmakers could not make a decision regarding the acting minister due to a lack of quorum in Monday's session.

Afghan Forces Consider Ways to Use Bagram Airfield
","
Since the US forces left their biggest base in Afghanistan--Bagram Airfield--Afghan forces are looking into ways to effectively use the facility.
The evacuation of the US forces from Bagram Airfield has been accompanied with many questions as well as concerns.  
TOLOnews reporter Khalid Nikzad was one of the first Afghan reporters who visited the base after the full evacuation. Sources told him that on Thursday night the lights at the base were turned off suddenly and then the last aircraft took off from the airfield.
Important equipment from the command center and the airfield's defense system was scrapped, and Afghan forces are considering what to do with the facility and the remaining equipment.
Over the last 20 years, many top US generals were at the command center to lead the Afghan war. Much equipment from the center has been either scrapped or has been transferred out by the US troops. 
According to sources, the lights at the base went off suddenly and then a big aircraft took off, carrying the last troops. Hours after that, the Afghan army entered the base. They succeeded in preventing some locals who wanted to enter the base to loot it. 
“Our priority, for now, is ensuring the security of the airport, inside and out, and assembling the remaining equipment from foreign forces. This equipment should be sorted and then we will decide how to use it,” said Asadullah Kohistani, an army commander in Bagram. 
At least 1,000 vehicles without armor, at least 50 armored vehicles, and hundreds of small and big installations with equipment and food have been left at the base. 
The defense system for rockets has been taken by US forces. However, the Afghan Civil Aviation Authority said that the radar and VSAT communication systems were reactivated at the base. 
“It shows the Presidential Palace’s wrong view toward Americans. Americans acted as Khalilzad once said: They will not ask permission from anyone, either entering or leaving,” said Tahir Yarghal, a former military officer. 
Another key component that has been left by US forces is the hospital. The hospital was famous during the last two decades for the treatment of patients, including civilians and officials. Some equipment at the hospital is worth millions of dollars. 
“We will reactivate the hospital with its existing facilities and we can provide urgent treatment to the forces,” said Nadir, a commander at Bagram Airfield.  
So far, it is not clear how the government will use the base. Some reports indicate that the Air Force Corps is expected to be stationed there. 
Bagram Airfield witnessed the presence of at least 100,000 troops at its peak back in 2020. It is located in Parwan province – 63 kilometers north of Kabul.

Admitting some shortcomings in protecting remote districts from falling to militants, the Afghan Army Chief Gen. Wali Mohammad Ahmadzai, who was newly appointed to his post, pledged that the top priority is to safeguard major cities, border towns and highways.
He said that the closure of border towns, supply routes and attacks on major cities and districts are among the goals of the Taliban, but he assured the people that such attempts will be repelled.

“There is no respect for anything ... the enemy is trying to conduct a trade war against us, create economic issues. They want to close the border towns through which wheat is imported for the people. They will never succeed. The Afghan people are vigilant and smart and know what this war is about,” Ahmadzai said.
The army chief said that the Taliban wants to first cut supply routes and then launch their offensives on districts and cities.
Meanwhile, an army commander said Pakistani Taliban are fighting the Afghan forces among the Taliban ranks. He said that at least 120 Taliban fighters are killed in attacks against Afghan forces on a daily basis.
“The Taliban cannot resist against us. If they bring 1,000 of them, 1,000 will die, if they come with 2,000,  they will die, and if one of them comes, that one will die, but this homeland will always shine, this flag will always fly,” the Maiwand Corps Commander Gen. Sami Sadat said.
“If terrorism is not defeated in Afghanistan, no doubt this war will reach Afghanistan’s neighbors, especially in the north,” Parliament Speaker Mir Rahman Rahmani said.
Gen. Ahmadzai was appointed to the post amid a steady fall of districts to the Taliban. At the same time, President Ghani also appointed Gen. Bismillah Mohammadi as the acting minister of defense.

11 Districts Fall to Taliban in 24 Hours: Sources
","
Sources said that 11 districts have fallen to the Taliban in the last 24 hours – seven districts in Badakhshan, two districts in Kandahar, one in Parwan and one in Helmand.
The districts are Maimai, Nusai, Shuki, Khwahan, Ishakashim, Shuhada and Yawan in Badakhshan, Nish and Mianshin in Kandahar, Nawa in Helmand and Shinwari in Parwan.
Badakhshan residents in northeastern Afghanistan said the security situation in the province is alarming, following the fall of 24 districts around the country to the Taliban in the last few days. 
“Weak management led to the collapse of the districts,” said Muhayyuddin Munsif, a senator. “The situation will worsen if they don’t review their plans.” 
“No district is under government control in Takhar after Worsaj collapsed. Only the city of Taluqan is under government control,” said Hamiduddin Yuldish, an MP from Takhar. 
Tajik media reported that at least 1,000 Afghan security force members have sought safety across the border in Tajikistan through the bordering areas of Badakhshan. 
“Only the Kiran wa Monjan district and the center of the district are left. Kiran Munjan will also be evacuated in the direction of Panjshir. Only Faizabad has been left. Based on our information, the Taliban has evacuated the outskirts of Faizabad – it could be for any reason,” said Zabihullah Atiq, an MP from Badakhshan. 
“A large number of special forces and the commandos have arrived in Badakhshan and we will soon start operations to retake the lost areas,” said Gen. Abbas Tawakuli, the commander of 207 Pamir Corps. 
Meanwhile, 16 army soldiers were killed in a Taliban attack on their outpost in Chesht district in Herat on Sunday night. However, the Defense Ministry said that 244 Taliban were killed in Afghan forces operations in the last 24 hours. 
“The defense and security forces, with the steady support of the people, will defend the cities, districts and Afghanistan in general, based on a specific security plan, and lost areas will be cleared of the Taliban,” said Fawad Aman, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense. 
The New York Times on Sunday wrote that US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin in a meeting with the current commander of US and NATO forces Gen. Austin Miller, Joint Chiefs Chaiman Gen. Mark A. Milley and Centcom head Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. discussed Afghanistan and specifically ways to buffer the impact of the US pullout on the Afghan people. 
On Friday, the US military left Bagram Airbase in Parwan province, north of Kabul, effectively ending US operations, although a contingent of US military personnel have been left behind to guard the US embassy.
Austin ordered a series of steps to slow the pace of the final withdrawal from America’s longest war, said The New York Times.

Afghanistan on Agenda in Indian FM's Upcoming Visit to Moscow
","
Afghanistan’s situation will be on the agenda in Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's visit to Russia later this week. 
Afghanistan will also be on the top of the agenda at several upcoming high-level meetings, including the annual India-Russia Summit, Hindustan Times reported.
The report quotes people familiar with the matter as saying that Russia sees India as an important player for formulating a coordinated response to the situation in Afghanistan.
According to the report, there hasn't been any formal announcement about Jaishankar’s visit to Russia, but he is expected to be in Moscow later this week.
Jaishankar’s visit to Moscow is a follow-up to the trip by his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, to New Delhi in April this year.
Quoting people familiar with the matter, Hindustan Times reports that the Indian external affairs minister and his Russian counterpart ""will discuss all bilateral and international developments, including the most vital and current issues such as Afghanistan.""
The visit will happen at a time that the Taliban has taken over a large number of districts, especially in northern Afghanistan that shares a border with Central Asian countries, something that has creates concerns in Russia as well as Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The group has taken over the Sher Khan Bandar crossing, north of Kunduz city, the main trade gateway into Tajikistan, over the last two weeks. Another border town, Bandar-e-Hairatan, in Balkh province, the main trade gateway into Uzbekistan, was under threat by the Taliban but the government announced last week that more troops were deployed to protect the town.
Reuters reported that Tajikistan's President Emomali Rahmon on Monday ordered the mobilization of 20,000 military reservists to bolster the border with Afghanistan. Reports indicate that more than 1,000 Afghan security personnel fled across the border in response to Taliban advances.
On Sunday, President Ghani in a phone conversation with his Tajik counterpart Emomali Rahmon discussed issues pertaining to ""Afghan citizens' seeking sanctuary at Tajik border areas after facing Taliban attacks."" 
Tajik President Emomali Rahmon expressed concern over the conditions caused as a result of the conflict, the Presidential Palace said. 
According to a Presidential Palace statement, President Ghani appreciated Tajikistan's showing goodwill to the displaced Afghans and said the Afghan government ""will adopt immediate measures to address their needs.""

Defense Ministers of Turkey, US to Discuss Kabul Airport Plan
","
A plan for Turkey to operate and guard the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul after the withdrawal of NATO troops will be discussed in a meeting between Turkish and US defense ministers, Reuters reported, quoting the Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar. 
The Turkish defense minister said he there is no final decision on the matter yet, Reuters reported. 
Amid security concerns in the country, Ankara recently offered to operate and guard the Kabul airport after the withdrawal of US and NATO forces, something that the Afghan government says is still under discussion. 
The goal has been to protect the diplomatic missions in Kabul if the situation deteriorates after the pullout of the US and coalition forces. 
Quoted by Reuters, the Turkish defense minister said talks on the details of the mission are still underway, and the airport must be operational so the Afghan government is not isolated from the world following the pullout. 
“From making certain decisions at the United Nations, NATO, to reaching an agreement with the Afghan government, as well as political, financial, and logistical support, we are in contact with various countries. Meanwhile, our talks with the Americans also continue,” Akar said as quoted by Reuters “No final decision has been made yet, but our talks continue.” 
On June 16, the National Security Council said the Afghan government is in talks over the security of the Kabul airport and that Afghanistan will make decisions about the issue in light of its national interests.

","
Qatar's Special Envoy to Afghanistan arrived in Kabul on Tuesday where he met a number of senior Afghan political leaders including former president Hamid Karzai to discuss how to expedite the stalled Doha peace talks. Al-Qahtani is also expected to meet Afghan government officials.
The visit of Special Envoy to Afghanistan Mutlaq al-Qahtani to Kabul comes as a group of politicians led by Abdullah Abdullah postponed a trip to Qatar for talks with the Taliban following an unprecedented escalation of Taliban attacks.
Sources told TOLOnews that Qatar intends to speed up the Afghan peace process with their appointment of a special envoy to Afghanistan.
Regarding the purpose of the envoy's visit, Hamdullah Moheb, the national security adviser, said: “He may talk about peace, about what Qatar can do in the current situation, what they think about the Taliban, whether they want peace or not.”
Meanwhile, sources told TOLOnews that Mohammad Younes Qanuni, Salam Rahimi, Karim Khoram, Ershad Ahmadi, Zahir Wahdat, and Mohammadullah Batash, have gone to Iran to consult on Afghan peace with the Taliban.
“The president should stand bravely and resign, and the Taliban should prepare for a ceasefire, they should come and launch real intra-Afghan peace talks,” said Baghlan MP Azim Mohseni.
A senior Taliban negotiator announced the continuation of talks with the Republic team in Doha, but Mustafa Mastoor, a senior adviser to the High Council for National Reconciliation, said that the Doha talks have faced an impasse due to disagreements between the Taliban and Republic negotiators.
“When the negotiation team of the republic's side is there, it is only at the contact group level, but it is very slow and not focused on substantial issues,” Mustafa Mastoor said.
Meanwhile, Taliban’s negotiator Sohail Shaheen in an interview with foreign media said there is no military solution to the conflict in Afghanistan.
“Military approach will bring victory but not a durable peace,” said Shaheen. 
Meanwhile, sources said that a delegation of Afghan politicians, including Mohammad Younis Qanuni, have traveled to Tehran to consult on the Afghan peace process.
At the same time, the prime minister of Pakistan warned that If the world does not pay attention to the situation in Afghanistan, the bloodshed will continue.
“We all endeavor to find a political solution in Afghanistan, chaos might be there but civil war should not be, because the civil war will harm Afghanistan more, it will harm Afghanistan's neighbor countries as well. Besides the immigration of Afghans, our relations with Central Asian countries might be affected, too,” Imran Khan said.

Broadcasting News against National Interests Is A Crime: AGO
","
The Attorney General's Office (AGO) said on Tuesday that broadcasting news that harms the national interest is being considered a crime.
The AGO warns that based on Afghan laws, the spread of rumors, conspiracies unrealistic and partial news by media will impact national sovereignty and the national interests of the country and is considered a crime.
The ministries of information and culture, haj and religious affairs, women's affairs, and the Attorney General's Office held a joint conference titled ‘Consulting conference on improvement of media quality and law conformity’ on Tuesday in Kabul.
High ranking authorities who participated in the conference praised the freedom of media in the last two decades but they criticized the activities of some of the news networks.
“The applicable law of the country deems the broadcast of baseless rumors, lies, conspiracies and biased news--which harms territorial integrity, state sovereignty and national interests--as crimes, and the laws are clear on how to act against the perpetrators of these crimes,” said Zabiullah Kalim, acting director for the Attorney General Office.
The minister of justice, while accusing some media of breaching laws, stressed that media should use “martyr” term for the victims of security forces who lost their lives in wars against enemies of Afghanistan.
“The martyr terms should be used for those security forces who lost their lives in defending their country, all mass media are obliged to use martyr term in accordance with the laws,” Fazel Ahmad Manawi said.
Other institutions who participated in the conference, while emphasizing the importance of impartiality in news coverage, said the media should not be a source of spreading fear or despair in the community.
Qasem Vafaeizadeh, the acting minister of information and culture, said: “The principle of neutrality has always been in front of our eyes during the editing of news. It does not mean that we should be a stage for spreading fear and panic in the community that has no positive message but only making people desperate.""
But the remarks in the conference have also drawn sharp criticism from a number of journalists and members of the media community. They asked officials in the conference to document the violations of the law by media networks and make it clear for them how the media outlets are breaching the law.

Afghan Forces 'Better Prepared' to Protect the Country: Karzai
","
Former President Hamid Karzai said on Tuesday that the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces are “better prepared” to protect Afghanistan on their own as international troops are leaving the country, but he reiterated that Afghans should deal with the ongoing foreign interference.   
“The Afghan forces are better prepared to shoulder the responsibilities of protecting the country on their own,” Karzai said in an interview with the BBC, but added that “the environment, the overall regional environment and the continuation of interference and undermining of the Afghan state is continuing” and that “that is something that we the Afghan people need to handle and handle sooner.” 
He said that at some point, the US and its allies “did very good” for a number of years in reconstruction of Afghanistan, “but subsequently, they began to rather than going and drying the sanctuaries outside of Afghanistan, in Pakistan, which is what they themselves reported about, they began bombing and hurting Afghan people and creating prisons in our own country.”  
“That led to where we are today,” he said.  
Karzai said that Afghanistan is not a failed state, adding that “as far as the Afghan people are concerned, they created a constitution, they went to the elections, they embraced democracy whole heartedly, they went to school, the educated themselves, we have millions of Afghan boys and girls educated today.”  
“We did all that we could to lead Afghanistan on the right track and to represent it well on the international scene,” he said. 
He said that the failure of the state that one would describe, especially in the western press, is exactly where the authority and the responsibility was more with the United States and its NATO allies.  
“That’s where things have failed and that’s where we the Afghan people are also being a price, a very heavy price,” Karzai added. 
In response to his reaction on US and NATO forces commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Scott Miller, Karzai said that the US general is “very wrong” about saying that there is possibility of a civil war in the country as the international troops are leaving. 
“Exactly for this reason I am telling you that that has failed. Instead of saying that they have helped Afghanistan stabilize, they leave, and the general leaving, is warning of a civil war. So that means they have failed but we Afghans have not,” he added. 
Karzai’s remarks come as Afghan forces have lost a big number of districts to the Taliban in the last two months amidst the withdrawal of US and NATO forces from the country.  
But the National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib on Tuesday assured that all districts will be retaken by Afghan forces.

“As of July 5, Department of Defense has retrograded the equivalent of approximately 984 C-17 aircraft- loads of material out of Afghanistan and has turned over nearly 17,074 pieces of equipment to the Defense Logistics Agency for disposition,"" the release stated.
CENTCOM did not say how many US troops remain in Afghanistan. Between 2,500 and 3,500 were in the country when President Joe Biden announced in April that all US forces would withdraw by Sept. 11, according to reports. 
On Tuesday, John F. Kirby, Pentagon spokesman, at a press conference said that the US Defense Department was in active discussions with the State Department regarding ""the nature of what that capability will be.""  
He mentioned that there's a carrier strike group in the region and facilities throughout the Middle East that could be useful if needed.

Kirby also discussed other bilateral activities with Afghanistan. 
There are still contractors in Afghanistan providing support to their security forces and air force, he said. ""We are actively working [on ways] in which that contract support can be done remotely or virtually or even physically outside the country."" 
About 650 troops are expected to remain to protect the US Embassy in Kabul, while others may be deployed to protect the capital’s airport alongside Turkish troops, according to reports.

US Intends to Keep 'Ongoing Presence' in Kabul: White House

White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday said that the US intentions are to maintain a continued presence in Kabul despite the US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.
“Well, first, I would say that we have every intention of continuing an ongoing presence in Kabul, which is continuing even after we bring our military, who are serving, home by the end of August,” Psaki said. 
“But we will also continue to be partners to the Afghan government. That’s something that the President reiterated when he met with leaders just a week and a half ago. That we — that includes security assistance, that includes humanitarian assistance, and that includes over-the-horizon capacity to ensure that we are working to address any threats that we face.” 
“That will continue, and we intend to have a presence on the ground in our embassy there in Kabul,” she further said. 
On the American troops withdrawal announcement by Joe Biden in April, she said: “if you take us back to when the President made this decision and announcement: We — he asked his team to do a clear-eyed assessment, not to sugarcoat it, of what the impact could be, of moving — withdrawing our troops from Afghanistan after a 20-year war — a war that the President continues to feel does not have a military solution.” 
“What the President is continuing to press on is a political solution and political negotiations and discussions, which we hope will reconvene soon, to move toward a political solution on the ground to bring greater peace and stability to the people of Afghanistan. That’s his hope,” he added.  
This comes as the US has completed “more than 90 percent” of its withdrawal from Afghanistan, the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.

“The efforts by Iran are focused on promoting regional cooperation regarding the peace process and regional consensus and to pave the way for intra-Afghan talks among Afghan politicians in Doha,” said university lecturer Faiz Mohammad Zaland.
Meanwhile, officials of the High Council of National Reconciliation (HCNR) said that the Tehran meeting is a small effort for peace. The HCNR also expressed hope that the Tehran meeting will persuade the Taliban to return to the peace negotiating table.
“The delegation which has travelled to Tehran is a small effort in this situarion, now lets see what comes out of this,” said Assadullah Saadati, deputy head of the HCNR.
According to the HCNR, peace negotiators in Doha are also expected to start serious talks about peace in the near future.
“The two sides are expected to talk about some serious issues, but these talks so far have not taken any clear direction,” said Assadullah Saadati, deputy of HCNR.

Rural Afghan Women Fear Loss of Rights in Peace Deal
","
A survey conducted by the Afghan Analyst Network (AAN) shows that rural women in Afghanistan have dire concerns about their rights after a potential peace deal with the Taliban.
AAN findings indicate that the women in remote regions of Afghanistan have a clear vision for peace, but they are concerned about a possible imposition of restrictions on the women as a result of a peace agreement with the Taliban.
These women have said that peace brings security, but it should not deprive women of their basic rights.
According to the report, several women mentioned that they hoped peace would give women and girls more access to their rights, including the right to education, employment and to choose whom they marry.
“I talked to a woman in Daikundi, she had never seen the Taliban and does not know what the takeover of the region by the Taliban means, but she was scared of the Taliban from what she has heard of the Taliban, and she feels fear that she would not be able to work alongside her husband in the field,” said Khadija Hussaini, a member of AAN.
“Others hoped they would be better positioned to help their neighbors and communities, that peace would afford them the possibility to plan and look ahead, have more energy and patience to take care of their homes and children and improve their relationships with the men in their households. Almost all imagined that the absence of the noise and news of war would allow them to be less anxious, maybe even happy,” the report said.
“The women in the villages, whether they lived under the control of the Taliban or not, have a clear vision for their future,” said Khadija Hussaini, member of AAN.
Meanwhile, a number of rural women in Balkh province told TOLOnews that despite being tired of war, they are not prepared to sacrifice their rights for peace.
Rabia is an Afghan woman who has fled war in Balkh district to another region.
“We did not bring anything with us, we have only a tfew old cloths, we don’t have food to eat,” said Rabia.
“My children and myself are in danger, they were threatened through different ways, if they (Taliban) find me and my children, they will kill us,” said Fatima, an internally displaced woman in northern Afghanistan.
“The anxieties the women expressed have, in the meantime, turned out to be all too well-placed. Many were explicitly worried that things would probably stay the same or get worse. They worried the situation would unravel or that ‘peace’ would result in greater Taliban control, more restrictions or a higher level of violence. Several women struggled with the possibility that there would be no accountability for those who had inflicted suffering on so many families,” said the report.
The report was prepared in one year. Women were interviewed in at least 19 districts.

10 Black Fungus Cases Reported in Afghanistan
","
The Afghanistan Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) on Wednesday said that the total number of black fungus cases in the country is now up to 10.
The health ministry said that the new cases of black fungus were reported from at least 5 provinces and all involved patients with COVID-19.
“Facemasks and oxygen provide a wet environment for black fungus, it is good if the masks are changed daily among the patients,” said health expert Hashmat Faizi.
“It can be found in the soil ... and in the air, those who work in the fields can be infected with this virus,” said Lais Mustafa, the head of the anti-COVID department at the Ministry of Public Health.
Health experts said that medicine for the disease is scarce in Afghanistan.
“We can hardly find the medicine,” said Abdul Manan, a patient.
According to the Ministry of Public Health, 62 new patients with COVID-19 died in the past 24 hours and over 1000 others were tested positive during this period.
According to health experts, COVID-19 significantly reduces patients’ immunity and opens the way for the fungal disease that affects patients initially in the nose, but the fungus can then spread into the brain, and can often only be treated by major surgery removing the affected part of the body.

Badghis: Attack on Qala-e-Naw Again Pushed Back
","
Clashes between security forces and the Taliban began on Wednesday after the group attacked several parts of the city.   
Afghan security forces on Thursday again pushed back a Taliban attack on Qala-e-Naw, the capital of Badghis province in western Afghanistan.
Clashes between security forces and the Taliban began on Wednesday after the group attacked several parts of the city.   
Thursday morning the Taliban launched attacks close to the police HQ building, military base, and the National Directorate of Security (NDS) department in the city, the source said.  
""The forces again responded to the Taliban’s attack,” said Shir Aqa Alokozai, adding that “the situation in Qala-e-Naw is under the control of the security forces.” 
Military commander Hasibullah Akhundzada said: “In the morning there were heavy clashes between the security forces and the enemy in Qala-e-Naw but now there are none, and the Taliban has fled after suffering casualties in those areas where they attacked.” 
Earlier on Thursday,  Ziauddin Akazi, an MP from Badghis, said that the Taliban had resumed their attacks on the city, and he requested reinforcements from the government. He also raised concerns about the civilian situation in the city.  
At least two civilians were killed and more than 60 others were wounded in the fighting over the past two days, according to the health officials. 
Local officials said that several security officials had surrendered to the Taliban before the group launched attacks on the city. 
Khawja Murad Murad, a security official, Abubaker Muradi, deputy head of the National Directorate of Security (NDS), Sarajuddin Payman, a commander of a security outpost, Omar Azimi, security officer of PD1, Nadir, a commander of an outpost of the police public protection unit, Khir Mohammad Arefi, a commander of a territorial army, and dozens of other security forces members surrendered to the Taliban without any clash, according to the officials.  
Khan Jan Zafar and Mohammad Farid Akhizai, two members of the provincial council, also surrendered to the Taliban, officials said.
However, the Ministry of Defense on Thursday morning issued a statement saying that “a large number of Afghan commandos have arrived on Wednesday night in Qala-e-Naw and clearing operations are ongoing.”  
The ministry also said that “at least 69 Taliban were killed, and 23 others were wounded during Wednesday’s airstrike in several parts of Qala-e-Naw.”  
The Taliban has not commented on the attack on Qala-e-Naw.  
In the meantime, local officials in Herat province said that security forces retreated from Zenda Jan and Keshk-e-Kohna districts of the province last night.  
Some parts of Pashtoon Zarghoon, Kohsan and Shindand districts of Herat also fell to the Taliban since last night, according to officials.

US Calls on Iran, Region to Support Afghan Peace
","
Ned Price, US State Department spokesman, on Wednesday, urged Afghanistan’s neighbors to play a constructive role in Afghan peace talks “in order for there to be a just and durable peace” in the country.
“What Iran is trying to do or is in the process of doing by hosting this meeting may well be constructive. I think the jury is still out. This is obviously not something we have discussed with the Iranians, other than by public--by making the point very publicly that Afghanistan's neighbors need to be responsible stakeholders,” Price said.
“For too long, many of Afghanistan's neighbors have been happy to see the United States engaged and the United States alone engaged. If there is to be a just and durable settlement and a comprehensive ceasefire, it needs to be supported, supported by Afghanistan's neighbors. And we hope to see them act responsibly,” he said.
On Wednesday, a Taliban delegation led by the group’s negotiator Shir Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai met in Tehran with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and other senior Iranian officials.
The Taliban delegation is expected to also meet with a group of Afghan politicians led by former vice president Younus Qanooni, who travelled there from Kabul.
The Taliban’s spokesman in Doha, Mohammad Naeem, on Twitter said that the Taliban delegation will hold talks with Iranian officials on bilateral issues.
“We are very proud that we remained alongside our Afghan brothers and sisters during the jihad of the Afghan people against the foreign invasion,” said Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in a meeting with the Taliban delegation in Tehran.
The US State Department spokesman also said that Afghanistan’s neighbors “need to use their influence in ways that are positive, in ways that are constructive, in ways that promote the cause of peace, in ways that support the people of Afghanistan.”
“We know that regional consensus and support for an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned peace process, it’s important for enduring peace. When it comes to the recent violence, this is something obviously we have spoken to quite a bit, and the point remains that no government that might come to power in Afghanistan through the use of force, at the barrel of a gun, will have legitimacy or the support, and that can be especially critical, from the international community,” he said.
“Nor would a government that comes to power by force have the support of the people of Afghanistan. And what we ultimately hope to help support and will seek to help support is a just and durable settlement,” he mentioned.
“Every party has an interest in a settlement being durable. The Afghan people have been burdened and, in many cases, brutalized by 40 years of civil war. The United States is supporting the efforts ongoing in Doha right now between the parties, where the parties are in fact still meeting, still talking, to see to it that we can have a just and durable settlement and a comprehensive ceasefire to finally see an end to this violence,” he added.
On Tuesday, the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) confirmed in a statement that the US has completed “more than 90 percent” of its withdrawal from Afghanistan.
This follows the US and coalition forces pullout from Bagram Airfield, which for nearly 20 years was the largest US base in Afghanistan.
“As of July 5, Department of Defense has retrograded the equivalent of approximately 984 C-17 aircraft- loads of material out of Afghanistan and has turned over nearly 17,074 pieces of equipment to the Defense Logistics Agency for disposition,"" the release stated.
CENTCOM did not say how many US troops remain in Afghanistan. Between 2,500 and 3,500 were in the country when President Joe Biden announced in April that all US forces would withdraw by Sept. 11, according to reports.
About 650 troops are expected to remain to protect the US Embassy in Kabul, while others may be deployed to protect the capital’s airport alongside Turkish troops, according to reports.

Tajikistan Asks Russia to Help on Afghan Border
","
Tajikistan on Wednesday called on members of a Russian-led military bloc to help it deal with security challenges emerging from Afghanistan, hours after Moscow pledged to defend its regional allies affected by the unrest, Reuters reported. 
The security situation in Afghanistan has rapidly deteriorated as foreign troops withdraw after 20 years. 
More than 1,000 Afghan government troops were reported to have fled north into Tajikistan this week as the Taliban seized dozens of districts in the past two months. 
In an appeal to the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), which includes Russia and five other ex-Soviet states, a Tajik official said his country could not handle the instability at its border without external assistance, the Reuters said. 
""Given the current situation in the region, as well as the remoteness and mountainous terrain of some parts of the border with Afghanistan, dealing with this challenge on our own seems difficult,"" the RIA news agency quoted Hasan Sultonov, the Tajik representative at CSTO, as saying. 
Sultonov's comments came after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow was ready to use its military base in Tajikistan, one of its biggest abroad, to ensure the security of its allies in the region. 
""We are closely watching what is happening in Afghanistan where the situation has a tendency to swiftly deteriorate including against the backdrop of the hasty exit of American and other NATO troops,"" Lavrov said. 
""We will do everything we can, including using the capabilities of the Russian military base on Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan, to prevent any aggressive impulses towards our allies,"" Lavrov said. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday told Emomali Rakhmon, the president of Tajikistan, that Moscow would help the impoverished former Soviet republic contend with the fallout from NATO's exit from neighbouring Afghanistan if needed. 
Rakhmon has ordered the mobilisation of 20,000 military reservists to bolster his country's border with Afghanistan after more than 1,000 Afghan security personnel fled across the frontier in response to Taliban militant advances. 
Also, Russia is prepared to activate a military base in ex-Soviet Tajikistan against advancing Taliban forces on its southern border as US troops finalize their pullout from neighboring Afghanistan, its top diplomat said Wednesday, The Moscow Times reported. 
Tajikistan is host to more than 6,000 Russian servicemen deployed to the Russian Ground Forces’ 201st military base, one of Russia's few military sites on foreign soil.

1,500 Public Force Members in Place to Defend Balkh
","
Balkh governor Mohammad Farhad Azimi said on Thursday that of the 5,000 fighters that were pledged by political leaders and other influential figures in Balkh as part of the public uprising forces, 1,500 have already been deployed in fighting positions to face the Taliban alongside security forces.
Azimi said that the political leaders have not managed to mobilize the entire number of fighters that were pledged to fight the insurgents.
According to Azimi, the National Directorate of Security (NDS) has prepared the list of those who are expected to fight alongside the Afghan National Security and Defense Force (ANDSF).
The government will equip members of the public uprising force with weapons, and they will get paid 10,000 Afs a month.
“5,000 fighters were mobilized, from which 1,500 were deployed along with security forces. The rest are waiting for equipment and weapons. They will also contribute to pushing back the enemy’s activities in close coordination with the security forces of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan,” said Azimi.
Meanwhile, the head of the Balkh provincial council said that in the past some elements misused the public uprising forces, and said that the same problem will be repeated if the public uprising forces are not led in the right way.
“One of the key reasons that led to the collapse of the district was that some people pledged to mobilize 100 fighters, but later on 20 of them were used in the right way, the remaining 80 were misused or they weren’t present at the job,” said Afzal Hadid, the head of Balkh provincial council.
The mobilization of public uprising forces has raised hopes over efforts to prevent the infiltration of the Taliban in the provinces.
“These fighters should be controlled so they do not get involved in armed robberies, taking revenge and committing other crimes,” said Abdul Hamid Sefwat, the head of Balkh Civil Society Union.
Local officials in Balkh have said that members of public uprising forces have been deployed in the defensive lines around Mazar-e-Sharif city and other districts.
Some commanders of the public uprising forces have said they are ready to participate in the clearance operations in areas under Taliban control if the government permits them to do so.

Meanwhile, in northern Afghanistan, a number of experts have raised deep concerns over the fragile security situation.
Referring to the recent evacuation of security forces from the districts, Abdul Latif Pedram, the head of the Afghanistan National Congress party, said that the withdrawal of security forces from some districts in the northern part of the country is linked to political and economic rivalries.
In southern Afghanistan, footage provided by the Afghan Ministry of Defense (MoD) shows the Taliban gathering bodies of slain fighters in Arghandab district of Kandahar after an air strike by the Afghan Air Force.

The US will have a counterterrorism over-the-horizon capability to act ""quickly and decisively"" if necessary, Biden said
Biden also said: “We will never forget those who gave the last full measure of devotion for our country in Afghanistan – nor those whose lives have been immeasurably altered by wounds sustained in service. We are ending America’s longest war, but we will always honor those who served in it.”
Asked if he trusted the Taliban, Biden also said ""no.""  BIden says Afghans have the capacity to keep the government in place. ""The question is--will they do it?"" Biden said, ""We are not going to walk away...""

Afghanistan Could Be on Path to Civil War: UK Military Chief

The UK military chief has warned there is the possibility that Afghanistan could be on a path to civil war as US and coalition forces leave the country.
Quoted by Reuters, Britain’s Chief of the Defense Staff, Nick Carter, said it was “plausible” that the country’s state would collapse without international forces there.
Afghanistan could see a situation like the country's 1990s civil war “where you would see a culture of warlordism and you might see some of the important institutions like security forces fracturing along ethnic, or for that matter, tribal lines,” Carter said as quoted by Reuters.
He added, “If that were to happen, I guess the Taliban would control part of the country. But, of course, they would not control all of the country.”
Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that after combat operations ended in 2014, around 750 British service personnel stayed in Afghanistan under NATO’s mission to train and assist the country’s security forces.
He announced that these troops are now returning home and that most have already departed Afghanistan. 
He reiterated that there is no military solution to the conflict in Afghanistan and that a sustainable, inclusive peace can only be achieved through a political settlement.

Taliban Says It Will Not Attack Provincial Centers

A Taliban delegation in Moscow said on Friday that it will not attack provincial centers – despite fighting by the group on the outskirts of many cities, including Qala-e-Naw in Badghis, over the last three days.
Sources from Kandahar on Friday said that the Taliban attacked District 7 of the city of Kandahar and captured two outposts.
The sources said that some residents of the area have left their homes, but Kandahar police said that more forces have arrived at the area to push back the Taliban attack.
Taliban negotiator Shahabuddin Delawar, who is in Moscow with two other members of the group, said that they will not attack cities to prevent bloodshed.
He said the reason behind their attacks is lack of addressing their demands for the release of their prisoners and removing the names of their leaders from UN blacklist.
Delawar said they are in talks with other Afghans to discuss a new system ""that should be Islamic, Afghan-inclusive and united.""
He added that they have “85% of Afghan soil under their control.”
According to him, they have over 250 districts in Afghanistan under their control and over 170 of them have been taken over in the last two months.
In response to a question whether they will favor a return of Taliban’s emirate, Delawar said that the issue will be decided upon in the intra-Afghan peace negotiations.
He said that all Afghan border towns taken over by the Taliban will remain active. He vowed to address traders' problems.
The Taliban members sought to signal that they did not pose a threat to the wider region however.
They said the Taliban will do all it could to prevent Daesh operating on Afghan territory and that it will also seek to wipe out drug production.
“We will take all measures so that Daesh will not operate on Afghan territory,” Delawar said. “Our territory will never be used against our neighbors.”

Ghani Says He Drove US Troops Out of Afghanistan
","
President Ashraf Ghani on Saturday said that he caused the “withdrawal of Americans from Afghanistan with dignity” and that he wrote a letter to former US president Donald Trump two years ago to leave Afghanistan.
“Did I ask them (the US) any day to remain here? Didn’t I say seven years ago that they will leave? Didn’t I send a letter to President Trump two years ago to leave?” he added.
 He said he sees the Taliban responsible for the ongoing violence in the country in which at least 200 to 600 people are killed every day.
Addressing a gathering in Khost province, Ghani asked the nation to stay united in support of independence, the republic and coexistence.  “The Taliban is responsible for the continuation of the war,” Ghani said. “The Taliban should be asked: Who are they are fighting for? Who will benefit if Afghanistan is ruined and if Afghans are killed?”
He added that they should also be asked if they are fighting for Afghanistan, or if they want the country to be controlled by others?
“If you love Afghanistan, promise me you have not accepted the Durand Line, promise me not to change Afghanistan from a roundabout to a one-way road, promise me you will not sell Afghanistan’s waters to others, promise me you will not serve others,” President Ghani said, directing the question at the Taliban.
He added that no one has doubts about where the Taliban comes from and where it is living.
“We want peace with everyone…. If 200 to 400 to 600 Afghans are killed every day, who will benefit from this? … I will tell you about Arghandab. They destroyed three bridges that cost at least $15 million, they bombed 1,000 homes,” Ghani said. 
He added that they are expected to sit with each other in future, so this should not happen today.  “Nothing is built through disunity,” Ghani said.
“If we started the war, I am telling you they will be blamed for it,” Ghani said, referring to the Taliban.  
“The Afghan government has made many efforts to move the peace process forward and wants peace, but the Taliban continued violence,” Ghani said. “They (Taliban) should attend the talks and not ruin their country being led by outsiders.”  
He mentioned that the fighting has not been lost on the battlefields, but it has been due to rumors and propaganda, indirectly referring to the recent loss of territory by Afghan forces to the Taliban.  
“I call on all Afghans to become united like the Khost residents and stand firm; otherwise, you will be responsible for six generations,” Ghani added.    
The Taliban has not reacted to these remarks so far.

Negotiators in Doha Held Talks on Five Key Issues: Sources
","
Peace delegations from the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban held a series of talks over the past few days with the talks reportedly focused on at least five key issues, including a future constitution, ceasefire, political roadmap and the political participation in the transition period, sources familiar with the process said.
Najia Anwari, a spokesperson for the State Ministry for Peace Affairs also said that serious discussions are taking place between the Afghan Republic and the Taliban negotiators in Doha in the past few days.
“These meetings are held after every single night between the two sides and the discussions are focused on a number of important issues,” she said.
The Taliban so far has not said anything about the topic.
Meanwhile, the US Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad has said that he was surprised by recent advances by the Taliban. However he added that a military takeover was not the solution to the conflict in Afghanistan.
“I’m not surprised that the conflict has intensified, but I am surprised by the progress that the Talibs have made and I’m hoping that the Afghan forces with help from their friends will find their bearing and push back. But again I repeat, there is no military solution,” said Khalilzad who architected a peace deal between the US and the Taliban in Doha last February.
“The Taliban know that they need to be accepted as part of the future of Afghanistan, not to be a pariah. To invade Kabul ans impose a government will put all the things they want internationally at risk. We will not recognize a government in Afghanistan that is imposed by force,” Khalilzad said.
The US State Department said that Khalilzad has started a new series of his trips to the region for Afghan peace.
“One of the key reasons for the situation that we face today is the unconditional withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan,” said Mir Haidar Afzali, the head of the parliament's defense committee.
Moreover, the US Serectary of State Antony Blinken after holding talks with his Pakistani and Qatari counterparts said that all these countries have a key role to play with regard to peace in Afghanistan.
“Without reaching an agreement with the Taliban, it would be difficult to bring peace in Afghanistan,” said MP Nematullah Karyab.
In the meantime, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has said that based on agreement with the US and NATO, Turkey will take responsibility of providing security to the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul.

The Taliban on Sunday announced its opposition to an agreement between the US and Turkey for the latter to take over security of Hamid Karzai International Airport, with a spokesman of the group saying that they are against the presence of any foreign troops after the given deadline for their withdrawal from Afghanistan.

“If they remain within the framework of NATO or Turkey or any other country, it will not be acceptable both for the people of Afghanistan and for the Taliban,” former Taliban commander Sayed Akbar Agha said. 
 
Erdogan announced the agreement on July 9.
 
“Our defense minister met with the US defense secretary, and we had a meeting with US and NATO to discuss the future of the Hamid Karzai International Airport,” Erdogan said on July 9. “We decided on what we accept in this respect and which conditions we don’t agree upon.”

Public Forces in North Lack Weapons: Sources

Amid questions over the formation of public uprising forces and doubts about their capability, sources from within these fighters' ranks said on Sunday that they are struggling with a lack of military equipment to fight against the Taliban.
They said they have repeatedly asked the government’s high-ranking officials to provide military equipment and weapons to the forces, but their requests have not been heard so far.
While dozens of fighters have pledged loyalty to former vice president Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum in the northern provinces against the Taliban, an aide to Dostum said that the government has not met its commitment to support the public uprising forces.
“We contacted them repeatedly. We asked senior security authorities, including the defense minister, the national security adviser, the NDS chief and the interior minister from the address of the High Council for National Reconciliation and the parliament, but unfortunately, they are not paying the required attention to equip and supply the public uprising forces,” said Enayatullah Babur Farahmand, a member of the leadership council of Junbish-e-Milli and the deputy head of the High Council for National Reconciliation.
“These forces will prove effective and the enemy will not succeed if they are not provided more support,” said Murtaza Jalali, a media adviser to Jamiat-e-Islami’s faction led by Ata Mohammad Noor.
Thousands of people have taken up arms in recent weeks in various provinces of the country to fight the Taliban following advances by the group in many provinces. Most of these forces have been formed in northern Afghanistan.

Interview with Taliban’s Zabihullah Mujahid: Full Transcript

The Afghan peace talks have been faced with a deadlock over the last few months. Violence has remained high in the country in the last two months following the start of the withdrawal of US and coalition forces from Afghanistan. In this interview, TOLOnews' Yaser Abrar speaks to Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, about a wide range of issues from ongoing conflicts, to the peace process and other current topics. 
Full Transcript:
TOLOnews: At least 129 districts have fallen to the Taliban in the last two months and of these 15 have been retaken by the government in recent days. The Taliban call it a victory, but the US said it calls into question the Taliban’s sincerity about wanting peace. 
 
What does the Taliban want? Do they want a political agreement, a surrender, or power through force? What is the ongoing war for and what justification does it have? Is there any hope for peace?  
 
All will be discussed in this interview with Mr. Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesman for the Taliban. 
 
Mr. Mujahid, hello and welcome to the program. 
 
Mujahid: Hello to you and to your listeners and readers and watchers. Thank you for the opportunity. 
 
TOLOnews: You captured the centers of 114 districts in two months. The Pentagon says that it questions your sincerity in the peace process. What is your response? 
 
Mujahid: In the name of Allah… I should say that 125 districts have been captured in two months and are under our control. This progress has not been by force or through war. You are aware that most of them were through the leaving of Kabul administration soldiers’ who moved to quit fighting and join us and we came closer to each other. We can say that in one or one-and-a-half months we had the least casualties, same was for the Kabul administration soldiers because there wasn’t a need for war and all areas were captured automatically and they joined us. This does not mean that it will call into question our will because you are aware that it is 16 months that we had reduced our operations for political matters and we had reduced our operations to 25%, which means that they were reduced by 75%. But despite that, the peace and negotiations process was moving forward slowly and it is slow right now, too; therefore, we could not sit with the other side. 
 
TOLOnews: But the people know that what you have said does not include all. There are many districts that have been captured through fighting. The centers of some cities were besieged by you for many days. The city of Pul-e-Khumri is an example. Ghazni is another instance. This act by your side has raised questions. You called it a victory in your statement seven days ago. The people ask: how can we understand this? Are you seeking a military takeover? Do you want surrender? What do you want? 
 
Mujahid: I want to explain this point briefly so that we can judge it better. The ceasefire ended on the 4th day of Eid al Fitr, June 11, 2021. The three days of Eid ended. It was the 4th day of Eid. Two army corps from the Kabul administration released statements that they would launch large-scale operations in areas under their command. They were the 215 Maiwand Corps in Helmand and 103 Thunder Corps of Paktia. Both released statements and all the media in the country made headlines from the statements. You can search them by entering “large-scale operation started against the Taliban.” It means it happened on the 4th day of Eid. When there is fight against us, when there is bullying against us, we have no option but to defend ourselves and our areas. Second, you have witnessed that two officials from security administrations, the Ministry of Interior and the National Directorate of Security, with the agreement of the Kabul administration reported to the Meshrano Jirga about their activities in the last year. Their report said that, as a big part of their report, they had a 50% increase in their operations against us where there was a 7% increase from our side in our operations. Now you compare 50% and 7%. Second, the Kabul administration, its leader Ashraf Ghani, at an event with commando forces, said that you conduct 50 attacks in a day in the country. This is on the record and you can search it. 50 attacks in a day against the enemy, against us. When 50 attacks are conducted in a day against us, and their attacks increase by 50%, and on the 4th day of a ceasefire, instead of calling for a ceasefire or progress in the political process, the extension of attacks is announced, then why should we stay calm and wait? This is our right. 
 
TOLOnews: Mr. Mujahid, don’t you think that the areas that you have retaken recently were under the government’s control not under yours. It means that the government says it has not attacked you to take over your areas, but you have come and done so. 
 
Mujahid: This has been due to the government’s weakness. This has not been because they are good and will not do this. If they want and if they can, they will eliminate us. They are seeking our killing 24/7. The fact that they cannot do it, that they don’t have the ability, is a separate thing. They say it but they cannot practice it but we should defend ourselves against the operations by the enemy. We started our movement, and we defended against the enemy. In this situation, the enemy’s forces are losing their morale. Everywhere we are informed about surrendering, until today. Even today as I am speaking to you, I got calls from four provinces, key bases contacted and told us they want to surrender and how should they do it. We cannot ignore these because they quit their fight. They ended their excuse for war. They put an end to insecurity. It would be better to clear these areas. Second, if you calculate, we had the least civilian casualties in the last month. It means that the enemy left vast areas and the common people are feeling calm. In this case, why shouldn’t we move forward? 
 
TOLOnews: The world has pointed a finger at you. The US charge de affaires asked you in a tweet to stop violence and return to the negotiations. Mr. Wison said that the world will not accept a government that is established through force in Afghanistan. A key question again: are you seeking a militarily takeover or through political settlement and peace? 
 
Mujahid. America itself came in by force. The current regime has been imposed through force. You remember that they came in by the use of B-52s and other types of aircraft 20 years ago. And some of them still have a presence here. They came by force and imposed the current situation on the people of Afghanistan by force. If they can use force, why not us? This is one. Two, we and America had an agreement 16 months ago and it has been released. You are aware. It mentioned that, first, the US forces and their allies, all, including NATO, will withdraw their troops from Afghanistan by May 1. Second, It (the agreement) says that no threat will be posed to the US and its allies from Afghan soil. Third, the intra-Afghan negotiations are started. Fourth, a ceasefire will be one of the issues under discussion in intra-Afghan negotiations. We signed this agreement with Americans. You tell me, now that May has passed, why the US forces have not left? … They did not leave by May. One violation. Second, no attack has been conducted on the US and its allies from Afghanistan. This shows our commitment to the agreement. Third, the intra-Afghan negotiations started. It was mentioned that the UN blacklist is to be removed three months after the start of the intra-Afghan negotiations and all prisoners released. Both were not done. Now, while the US is not implementing its commitments or the commitments cannot be implemented by the US--or it does not want to do it--why should we remain committed to what was agreed? 
 
TOLOnews: But you know, Mr. Mujahid, that a big part of the foreign forces have left Afghanistan. A CENTCOM commander a few days ago said that the retrograde has been over 50% completed and that the number will be zero by Sept. 11. You agreed in the Doha agreement to some issues. Cutting your ties with al Qaeda and other terrorist groups is one of those key issues. Were you committed to it? 
 
Mujahid: No doubt, we were committed. First, why was it (the withdrawal) delayed until September? We agreed after 18 months of negotiations. Now why it is 5%, why is there even one US soldier in Afghanistan? 
 
TOLOnews: But you know that this presence will be zero. 
 
Mujahid: We witnessed the other day that Americans conducted airstrikes on our forces, on civilians, and admitted that they did airstrikes. This is against the agreement. 
TOLOnews: Mr. Mujahid, now allow me to mention some key issues. On October 20, 2020, Abdul Mohsin al Mesri, the number 2 of al Qaeda, was killed in Andar district in Ghazni, an area under your control. The United Nations said on Oct. 31, 2020, that al Qaeda fighters are among Taliban ranks and that it is a violation of the Doha agreement. On Nov. 10, 2020, Mohammad Haneef known as Abdullah, the deputy leader of al Qaeda for the Indian subcontinent, was killed during bomb-making training being given to your members in Bakwa district in Farah. You demanded the release of Asim Omar’s spouse as part of the release of 5,000 prisoners – by the Afghan government. If you look at the 1267 Committee of the UN’s report on Feb. 7, 2021, and a report by the US Treasury Department on Jan. 26, 2021, all say that the Taliban still maintains ties with al Qaeda and other terrorist groups.    
   
Mujahid: You should also listen. First, I hope that you read the agreement as it has been released and no part of it has been kept hidden.   
   
TOLOnews: Absolutely. I have read it carefully.   
   
Mujahid: Nowhere in the agreement has it been mentioned that we have or don’t have ties with anyone. In fact, the issue of relations is not considered. What has been agreed upon is that no threat should be posed from Afghan soil to the US and its allies.   
   
TOLOnews: From al Qaeda and other terrorist groups?   
   
Mujahid: Yes, yes, from all. In a situation as in war--and we are involved in a big war--we cannot clear our soil or our areas, or have surveillance, or in a situation where there are contested areas, non-contested areas and areas where neither we nor the enemy has a presence – non-governed areas, in such a situation, it is not possible that there aren’t some violations or that they don’t happen at all. In any case, we are not involved in it. The reports that have been published are either from the Kabul administration or from America.  This is the enmity of our enemy.   
   
TOLOnews: They are from the United Nations.    
   
Mujahid: The United Nations itself relies on US reports or it gets information from the National (Directorate of) Security of the Kabul administration.   
   
TOLOnews: Your remarks can indicate that you have not promised in the Doha agreement to cut your ties with al Qaeda and your relations are maintained so far.   
   
Mujahid: First, it has not mentioned anything about relations. The relation between Muslims in the world is in faith. This is not logical at all. The issue was also mentioned in our negotiations. We explained this to the Americans--what this relation means. In fact, we don’t have any relations with anyone after 20 years to cut now. As Muslims, we share faith and belief in God. Under these circumstances, we have relations with all the Muslim world. What do relations mean? (We were asked) to make sure that the US will not face any threats from Afghan soil. This is what has been mentioned in the agreement. We are committed to the contents of the agreement, not to what is said by the media or other individuals.   
   
TOLOnews: You’re saying that relations are maintained?
Mujahid: No, the relations our – It does not mean the relations that you say. We didn’t have relations over the last 20 years.   
   
TOLOnews: If you don’t have relations, Mr. Mujahid, how come Abul Muslim al Misri was killed in Andar district in Ghazni?   
   
Mujahid: I told you, no evidence has been shown to us regarding this. We asked for the evidence. Where is his body?  And … So far, no one has provided this to us. These are allegations on the TV and radio.
   
TOLOnews: Where is Abu Muslim al Misri? Do you know, Mr. Mujahid?   
   
Mujahid: We don’t know his whereabouts. We don’t know actually where he is. Again, the country is at war, half of the country is not in our control, we have open borders, we are at war, we don’t have the Interior Ministry and the intelligence under our control to monitor all citizens, to know who is there and who is not, who makes a movement and who does not. Anything is important under such a situation, but they should provide evidence about whether any threat has been posed to the US from Afghanistan’s soil or whether there is any intention for this.  
 
TOLOnews: You had agreed that your released prisoners will stay committed to the Doha agreement. It means that they will not return to the battlefield. If we summarize the question: Where is Mali Khan who was released along with Anas Haqqani and Hafiz Rasheed? Former NDS chief – Rahmatullah Nabil – says he is leading the fighting in Paktia province.  
 
Mujahid: I am once again asking you to read the agreement carefully. Nowhere in the agreement has mentioned that our prisoners should not return to the battlefield once they are released.  
 
TOLOnews: But you have committed that they will remain firm to the contents of the Doha agreement.  
 
Mujahid: Yes, we are committed. Those who are fighting now, they too are committed. It means that no threat will be posed to the US from Afghanistan’s soil. It means that if the US forces leave the country, we are committed – it means that if the intra-Afghan negotiations are held, all of us, including the prisoners, are committed and if they are discussing ceasefire, we all are committed. Where is the question in it? We are committed to every content of the agreement.  
 
TOLOnews: Then many of your prisoners have returned to the battlefields and Mali Khan is leading the fighting in Paktia?  
 
Mujahid: No. I am repeating this matter. No, no one of our prisoners has returned to the battlefield. They (released prisoners) are suffering from physical and spiritual problems and some of them had family problems. All are busy. I am telling you an example. A short example as it has not been discussed by anyone so far. The Islamic emirate of Afghanistan was reviewing its structure. Some governors and officials were shifted. In three or four instances, some individuals who were recommended for district governors and lower positions were those who were released among the 5,000 (prisoners). Hence, the recommendation went for approval to the emir-ul-muminin and our leader so that the changes are applied. When he saw their past that they were in prison (and have been released), he rejected it (and ordered) that all those who have been released should stay at home and have no right (to violate) the agreement.  
 
TOLOnews: Mr. Mujahid!  
 
Mujahid: One is rumors and another are realities –  
 
TOLOnews: Do you confirm that Mali Khan leads the fighting in Paktia?  
 
Mujahid: No, no. It is not led by Mali Khan. The fighting in Paktia is led by the Paktia governor.  
 
TOLOnews: Where is he (Mali Khan)? In Doha?  
 
Mujahid: No, he is at his home. Haji Sahib Mali Khan is now under treatment and is at his home. Of course, I don’t know where is he but he is not on the battlefield.  
 
TOLOnews: Mr. Mujahid. What is the name of the current war in Afghanistan? A jihad? Killing of Muslims? Killing of brothers? What is it?  
 
Mujahid: It is jihad, a sacred jihad against occupation, against (the supporters) of occupation, against sedition.  
 
TOLOnews: But you know that in 1397 (2018), 100 religious scholars from 37 countries gathered in Saudi Arabia, where the secretary general of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation also attended. They said that shedding people’s blood in a Muslim country is haram (forbidden). In Mizan of 1399 (Sept. 2020), the International Union of Muslim Scholars announced that the ongoing war in Afghanistan is absolutely forbidden and is the killing of Muslims. In Aqran 1399 (Oct. 2020), 2,000 religious scholars gathered in Kabul and called the ongoing war in Afghanistan ""forbidden."" On May 29, 2021, Egypt’s grand mufti Dr. Ibrahim Abdel-Karim Allam called the war forbidden and illegitimate and said that the killing of one Muslim is equal to the killing of all humanity and is worse than desecration to the Kaaba. On December 8, 2020, religious scholars from Muslim countries gathered in Nigeria and said that this war should immediately end. We can mention Dr. Sheikh Ekrima Sabri as among them; Ekrima Sabri, the imam of al Aqsa Mosque, said the war in Afghanistan is illegitimate based on Verse 94 of Surah An-Nisa. Three weeks ago a conference was held in Mecca with the participation of religious scholars from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The OIC three weeks ago said that with the start of the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan, the continuation of the war in Afghanistan is the killing of Muslims. Don’t you accept all these?  
 
Mujahid: I hope you also listen as well. First, when our jihad started against America, none of the figures that you mentioned issued a fatwa to do jihad and it is a need, your country is under occupation, so should we have to listen to them about ending the war now? Second, those whom you mentioned, an absolute majority of them are the government officials in their countries and are under US pressure. When (John) Nicholson was NATO’s commander in Kabul, he said that they will increase religious and military pressure on the Taliban so that they are pushed for the negotiations. He explained religious pressures, that they will ask world scholars to talk against the Taliban. Under current circumstances, no religious scholar who is independent, credible and trustworthy has said a word except those who have jobs in governments or are talking by the dictation of their governments against the war. Their discussion was one thing and their words were misinterpreted. For instance, we talked to al Aqsa mosque’s imam and asked him whether he has said such a thing and he said that he hasn’t made such a remark at all. The al-Aqsa imam told (us) that jihad against the US is jihad and no one can deny it.  
 
TOLOnews: But there are reports that the meetings of religious scholars from Muslim countries –   
 
Mujahid: I will come to that. First, all these gentlemen were dictated to say such words. Second, our jihad was not started with their fatwa to be ended with their fatwa. Third, there is a principle in Islamic jurisprudence. It is a scientific topic. A principle that when you are issuing a fatwa on an issue you need to investigate the issue from both sides. If the two sides are not present, it is not allowed to issue a fatwa against it. All the muftis that you mentioned, even one of them has not sit with us to ask us why are you fighting and what is the issue? So that we explain and then they would issue a fatwa. They are asked about whether the killing of Muslims is legitimate, they say no. If you mention in a fatwa that the killing of the puppets of America, who have killed their nation by standing with the US over the last 20 years, are standing against their religion, have enmity with it, are protecting the US system and interests, protecting New York and Washington, is their killing legitimate nor not? Then the mufti – I contend that in this case if the mufti said it is illegitimate, I will pay the compensation. This can happen when muftis come and sit with both sides, including us and the other side, and then they decide for us. Issuing a fatwa unilaterally is not credible, it is a political matter, it is not a religious matter, we are not respecting it, we have our own scholars, our own muftis. Most of us are scholars, we know the religion. They did not consider jihad against the US legitimate. They denied jihad at the beginning and they are denying it now.  
TOLOnews: Who should issue a fatwa? I mentioned OIC, the International Union of Muslim Scholars, the grand mufti of Egypt, the imam of al Aqsa mosque, all of them. Who should issue a fatwa so that the war ends and you accept?  
 
Mujahid: These people, but under the conditions for a fatwa, in which we are also there, as well as the other side.  
 
TOLOnews: Are you ready for such a session?  
 
Mujahid: The rules for fatwa should be applied. It means that the issue on which a fatwa is issued should be explained in detail. In that case, it will be credible.  
 
TOLOnews: Are you ready?  
 
Mujahid: We have scholars. Why should we challenge the world? The world has its own scholars, has their own issues. Afghanistan has its own scholars. We don’t do the Salah (prayers) by the saying of the muftis of Egypt or Aqsa, we pray by the saying of our own scholars.  
 
TOLOnews: Then you don’t accept it?  
 
Mujahid: No, they are all political fatwas. They are issued under Nicholson’s pressure, under the dictation of the US. They are unilateral. They have no legitimate basis.  
 
TOLOnews: But the people would ask which of these fatwas they would consider political? Anyhow. When you take over Anar Dara district in Farah, some other parts too, you said that they were taken over without fighting. But you detonated the district governor’s compound and the NDS building by chanting Allah o Akbar. People are asking: what type of jihad is this? What was the sin of the building? Was it infidel?  
 
Mujahid: Yes, it’s a good question. I should say that as I and you are talking today, 125 districts have been taken and captured. One case has happened. Another in another place.  
 
TOLOnews: In Andkhoi district in Faryab?  
 
Mujahid: Yes.  
 
TOLOnews: Of course, we know your reaction about Andkhoi, but about Anar Dara?  
 
Mujahid: No, not in Andkhoi; it was in another place. I will tell you about it. In Ana Dara, the building that is demolished is not only for the district. It was the police headquarters and the NDS facility and there was a big plain area in front of it. When the mujahedeen were there, they reported that the enemy had taken out a large number of forces and is planning to retake the district and will attack the district. It is a military place and it is a place that has no place for resistance. There is a wide plain area. If the enemy had come and had taken over the stronghold, the mujahedeen would not have been able to resist behind it, and if we had fought from behind it, they would have used it as a stronghold, and then we could not –   
 
TOLOnews: But what people know is –   
 
Mujahid: It was a military decision. A military decision was made that this stronghold of the enemy should be demolished as a stronghold. This is a necessity of fighting-- in some areas, if we demolish them it does not mean that we are against the enemy’s interests or we need to do it, or we need to ruin the country. We should destroy the enemy’s stronghold. The enemy would kill people if they get to the stronghold.
TOLOnews: But if your goal was to govern, you could have used (the buildings) as your own, Mr. Mjuahid. 
 
Mujahid: It is war. Later we can use it. If the country is built, we can rebuild it at a low cost. During fighting, someone sits and makes a stronghold to kill me, then I have the right to demolish the enemy’s stronghold. You cannot make a stronghold in people’s houses that have been built in the last 20 years. 
 
TOLOnews: But the understanding the people get from this, what the people see is destruction, and people don’t want their homeland to be ruined.  
 
Mr. Mujahid, where is your leader Mullah Hibatullah?  
 
Mujahid: He is in the country. I cannot say specifically about his whereabouts due to security reasons as you know. But he is in the country and is leading a vast and extended jihad. 

TOLOnews: Then why does your delegation in Doha travel to Pakistan for a consultation? 
 
Mujahid: This is not true. They have never gotten advice. 
 
TOLOnews: You know that Mr. Mullah Baradar went to Pakistan at the end of the first round of negotiations. A video was shared online that showed him at a hospital in Karachi, visiting your wounded (fighters). Then he appeared at a gathering of your members where he told them that all our leaders are here and that the treatment of our wounded is not possible in the country, in our own country, and we have no option but to tolerate this situation. This video exists. 
 
Mujahid: I am making clear one thing for you. The visit by Mullah Baradar Akhund to Pakistan was an official visit for a meeting with the leaders of the Pakistani government. There, in Pakistan, we have 3.5 million refugees. Among them, there are individuals, or people, who come to Afghanistan for jihad, are wounded, get sick, die,  get martyred, and are returned to their families along the Durand Line or in the Waziristans or Baluchistan or in some contested areas. We have refugees in these areas. 3.5 million people. In other words, we have 35 lakhs people there. Among them, thousands might be our people, their families across the Durand Line. They come, they are wounded, they get sick and while going across the line, of course, they go to hospitals and doctors in that country. They have been there for 20 years, 30 years, have used hospitals and medicine there. 40 years. Now that Mullah Baradar Akhund goes there and visits some patients there and would tell them that he is here. This has no harm. It was an official visit. It was not a consultation with anyone. When you go to Pakistan, you have helped national issues. 
 
TOLOnews: But Mr. Mujahid, this video is there. It is on social media. He says among your members in Pakistan that all our leaders are here. You know that Pakistan’s Interior Minister Rasheed Ahmad in his recent interview with Geo News said that the families of many Taliban leaders are in Pakistan. He provided the address. In Loi Ber, in Bara Kuhah. 
 
Mujahid: Again, I would say that our members might be there in Pakistan because we have refugees there. Our members might be among the refugees, their families might be there, and they do jihad here, and then they go to visit their families there. Their families have been there for 40 years. They migrated there in the previous jihad. We don’t deny this. But let’s say it this way. Let’s look at whether Pakistan has influence on these people. Our leaders were martyred in Pakistan. Mr. Mansoor was traveling in a border area from one place toward Khakris in Kandahar. He was martyred on the way. Mullah Baradar Akhund was imprisoned in Pakistan for eight years. Our governors, our authorities. 
 
TOLOnews: Mr. Mullah Omar passed away in Pakistan.  
 
Mujahid: No, no. This is wrong. He passed away in Shinkai (district) in Zabul. 
 
TOLOnews: But the report –  
 
Mujahid: Mullah Obaidullah was martyred in a Pakistan prison. There is no report about him. He was arrested by Pakistan. When our leaders are faced with such a fate there, how can it be a safe home for us, or a place for consultation? 
 
TOLOnews: Right, but as I mentioned, Pakistan’s interior minister said that the families of many Taliban officials are in Pakistan. And meanwhile, he asks you not to allow TTP (Tehreek Taliban Pakistan) to operate in Pakistan. What is your answer to the Pakistani interior minister? How does he give himself the right to say this? 
 
Mujahid: We have rejected these remarks. You might have heard the recent remarks by Pakistan’s foreign minister in the interview with Mr. Najafizada. He did not make such remarks. But he rejected it. Now Pakistan should make its interior and foreign ministers coordinated and then it should come and criticize. We rejected that there is no family of our leaders there, and our leaders are also not there. Of course, we have refugees. Three million Afghans are there (in Pakistan) and they are maybe in Iran too. Our refugees are also in Dubai, Saudi Arabia and other countries like Qatar where we have families of our members. No doubt, they went there during the fighting and they migrated. They had to leave their homes and leave, but it does not mean that all became puppets of countries or all were sold. 
 
TOLOnews: Mr. Mujahid, why are Pakistanis fighting in your ranks?  
 
Mujahid: This is a good question. It has not been approved anywhere. It is just words on Facebook as a photo from Paktia was posted a few days ago. They were the individuals who are alive and have not been killed. They are in Kashmir. They are Kashmir’s mujahedeen. 
 
TOLOnews: Mr. Mujahid, one of the individuals who was arrested on –  
 
Mujahid: They are among the posts on Facebook. 
 
TOLOnews: They have Pakistani ID cards? 
 
Mujahid: No! Let me tell you. We followed that person. He is living in Saudi Arabia. He was traveling to Saudi Arabia through Afghanistan because the flights to Saudi Arabia (from Pakistan) were stopped due to the COVID-19 spread. He was going to Saudi Arabia. He had his visa and passport with him. He was arrested in Paktia and they claim he was a Pakistani soldier. If he is from the Pakistani army, if this country has a leader, if someone attempts a military interference, or if a military person is arrested in a country, the ambassador is summoned, the foreign minister makes criticism, the issue is made international and it is criticized. How has it happened that no one on the diplomatic front took any steps? This is propaganda on Facebook and Twitter. You make accurate research. That person is a Saudi-bound traveler. He has neither seen the army nor war and he didn’t come here for that. He was going to Saudi Arabia because flights are banned to Saudi Arabia from Islamabad. 
 
TOLOnews: But that person says in his remarks that he was trained in Pakistan for one and a half years and he says he was asked by Pakistanis to go to the Taliban ranks and fight along with other Pakistani military people. 
 
Mujahid: Such things are expressed under torture. They would say such things under torture to do propaganda against the Taliban. 
 
TOLOnews: Mr. Mujahid, many things are said about a peace plan for Afghanistan. Where is the Taliban’s plan? For instance, on political structure, your conditions, your perspective? 
 
Mujahid: Our peace plan is in our pocket. When we sit for talks and when negotiations are started, we will present the plan and discuss it. That is not for the media. 
 
TOLOnews: Are the people important? Should they know the details of the plan or not? Some say that it is questionable when we don’t read a plan. You have resources for presenting this. You have a website. People say that we should know your mandate, your programs. 
 
Mujahid: No, it is one of the matters that would be discussed in negotiations. When it comes to people’s access, when we discuss something and when we agree on it, then we will share it with the people. 
 
TOLOnews: Apart from negotiations, Mr. Mujahid. What you have in your mind and say that is in your pocket, why do you not share it with the people? People should know what is actually in your mind? 
 
Mujahid: You know that topics that are discussed in negotiations by two sides are not final. In other words, they are not decided upon. 
 
TOLOnews: We are not talking about negotiations. 
 
Mujahid: No, no. The challenges we see and the things that are out on the media. It is true that our friends will listen and will realize, but those who are waiting to hurt peace, are not letting peace be established and they are not allowing progress in negotiations. They are challenging it and are creating hurdles in its way. Then discussions will get controversial. You witnessed how long discussions took on rules of the talks and how our people were affected by the reactions, even the issue of Shia and Sunni was raised. It has these issues in its background. 
 
 
TOLOnews: We have limited time – for the interview. For instance, you often say Islamic system and it is challenged at a higher level here in the Afghan government. Should the people know or not what is the Islamic system that you are talking about? Should this be explained or not? 
 
Mujahid: No, it has an explanation. The Islamic system is not a secret thing. Islam talks about system. The Islamic jurisprudence is full of it. All Muslim scholars and our scholars who study Islam know the issue of what an Islamic system means. It means that all Islamic laws are implemented. It means building a system based on the principles of jurisprudence. It means that good people are part of a system, decision makers are experts, advice is given by experts, the leader is Muslim and honest, just, educated and should be the one who is committed to the religious principles, who should have virtue, should not be an embezzler, a robber, should not have been dictated to from abroad, should have deep knowledge of Islam because he leads a Muslim country. These are its conditions. 
 
TOLOnews: Let me ask you two specific questions. The Islamic system that you say. Shouldn’t it be Republic? Two, should election be part of it? 
 
Mujahid: These are issues under discussion by all Afghans –  
 
TOLOnews: What do you want?  
 
Mujahid: The system we want should be based on the Shora-e- Ahl al-hall wal-aqd (the people of losing and binding, a term used in political aspects of Islam that referring to those qualified to appoint or depose a caliph or another ruler on behalf of the Ummah) or the religious scholars’ council or scholars, those who have understanding and knowledge. They should make the system. 
 
TOLOnews: Then, elections are rejected? 
 
Mujahid: According to our view, elections have not been effective. We saw the consequences of elections over the last 20 years in the country. 
 
 
TOLOnews: But from 57 Muslim countries in the world, an absolute majority of them are either republic or like a republic, and some of them have experienced elections and have been successful. 
 
Mujahid: No, they are not. No country has been successful. Muslim countries that have experienced elections are faced with problems and challenges. Pakistan is the most indebted country in the world. It has elections. In some other countries, too, there are issues. In Iran, too, they have elections, but their people are not happy. You witness Mehdi Karroubi and protests there. Also, in other countries, Turkey now has been left with no option but to change the conditions and it amended the law many times. In Egypt, elections led to failure. Even Mr. Mursi was imprisoned and was martyred. Algeria failed. Other countries too. 
 
TOLOnews: You have a problem with the republic system, and an emirate is your red line? 
 
Mujahid: We don’t have a problem. It is not our recommendation. Republic is not our recommendation. It might be discussed, but the system that we want is an Islamic system. 
 
TOLOnews: Is Islamic emirate your red line, or not, Mr. Mujahid? 
 
Mujahid: No, we cannot call it a red line because it is under discussion. We cannot impose a unilateral decision on the people. We should have negotiations and their consequence will be a redline. 
 
TOLOnews: Right, then an Islamic emirate is not your red line. I have some short questions.  
 
Mujahid: No, no, it is our demand. It is not a red line for us because before saying anything, we should discuss it. We don’t call a redline anything that maybe we might fail in (achieving) later. 
 
TOLOnews: Right. Some short questions. What is your view on the freedom of speech, Mr. Mujahid? For instance, in your government or any government in which you are part of, can a reporter criticize your leader or cabinet minister? 
 
Mujahid: No doubt, he can. During Islam’s height, Hazrat Omar was Muslim’s caliphate. He was criticized. Criticism is a need. Criticism itself means reform. Or reforming something. It means that someone tries to reform our minister or gives him advice. 
 
TOLOnews: Like today or less than that, Mr. Mujahid? You see that here at TOLOnews we criticize the president with the strongest words, we challenge him, we invite him. Like today or less than that? 
 
Mujahid: No, no. There is one thing. One is insult, character assassination, and one is criticism. It if is healthy, it will be very good. 
 
TOLOnews: What is what we do today? 
 
Mujahid: We cannot approve today’s media because it is 20 years that these media outlets are financed from one side for personal goals. Sometimes they fuel ethnic issues, sometimes discrimination and sometimes create fights among the people. 
 
TOLOnews: These should be proved. What you say is in the realm of claims. 
 
Mujahid: No, it is not a claim; it is proved. 
 
TOLOnews: The freedom of speech that you say is more limited or less than today? 
 
Mujahid: No, it will be more reformed than today. 
 
TOLOnews: Okay. What does this reform mean? 
 
Mujahid: It means that insulting individuals is not allowed. 
 
TOLOnews: For instance, what we do is an insult? 
 
Mujahid: Yes, we were insulted, many times, in your media outlets. 
 
TOLOnews: Okay, can a woman present news in a government that for instance you are part of? 
 
Mujahid: Let’s leave this to that government and laws – that will decide whether they can or not. (And to decide that) if they can, what will be the conditions. 
 
TOLOnews: What is your view: Can women work as reporters? 
 
Mujahid: Now we cannot decide. It is an issue of laws and details. When a government is built, it needs details and laws. I don’t want to talk as a spokesman of one side, and discover a law for all of Afghanistan and ask its full implementation. There are principles in Islamic logic. 
 
TOLOnews: You are an authorized representative and you can pass on the Taliban’s view. For example, which areas can women work in? Can she become president? Can she sing? Can she be a journalist, or not? 
 
Mujahid: No, no, she cannot become president. Islamic jurisprudence does not allow it. But she can work in her own area. It means that in an area where women’s dignity, her family’s dignity is safe and is protected. In this case, she can work, she can do education, can do social activities, but she should follow Islamic principles. 
 
TOLOnews: Can she sing? 
 
Mujahid: You tell me. Can she (sing) under Sharia? 
 
TOLOnews: I am not supposed to answer. I asked you about it.
Mujahid: No, no. You are born in a Muslim family. After all, you are a Muslim, al Hamdulellah. Can she (sing)? 
 
TOLOnews: As a reporter, my responsibility is to ask, Mr. Mujahid, not to respond. 
 
Mujahid: Anyone can respond to this. A Muslim is a Muslim. 
 
TOLOnews: I want to know the Taliban’s view because everyone has a different view. 
 
Mujahid: No, she cannot (sing). In Islam, she cannot. This is not our view; this is Islam’s view. If you don’t know it, you should know it… You should ask a scholar. 
 
TOLOnews: Right. What I ask does not mean that I don’t know. I ask it as a reporter and want to know your view. 
 
Mujahid: The thing that is evident should not be asked. 
 
TOLOnews: For instance, you said in Aqcha (district in Jawzjan) that women cannot go out of the home without a Mahram (a companion). People might ask that –  
 
Mujahid: This is a rumor. Aqcha also witnessed such rumors. In Takhar, too, it was said in many instances that rules and regulations have been imposed, and it is time for laws. This is possible when a system is built. People come under law, and have an early mindset preparation for it. Then laws are formed, and are approved with the approval of council, and then the law of a country is made public, and then it is implemented. It has a specific procedure for itself. Anyone does not opt to implement laws. We investigated what was said in Aqcha and Takhar and some areas that we heard of. Nothing was done there. This is propaganda to disrupt (people’s) minds. 
 
TOLOnews: Two last questions… Many said-- including Americans and those who met with your delegation in Moscow and other places--that the Taliban has changed and the Taliban are not those who were in the 1990s. Do you agree with this sentence? Haven’t they changed? 
 
Mujahid: I should interpret it in another way. It is in interpretation. We have gained more experience. We have gotten more information. Or, when people get older, of course, they show more flexibility, their experience is increased. It means that we might have changed. We might have gained more experience. We were young and had feelings. When people get older, a movement also gets older. It will have its own flexibility. It means that it is completed, becomes more knowledgeable, gets more experience. In this interpretation, yes, there might be changes. 
 
TOLOnews: For instance, if you take over a province or you take part in a government or if a government is under your control, will women be lashed on their feet or will they be lashed or not? Can they go out without a companion or not? 
 
Mujahid: One is an issue pertaining to Sharia. About this I must say that we cannot change the principle of Sharia. The fact that whether we have changed, like some mujahedeen leaders who shaved their beards to show they have changed and wore suit and tie, this type of change is banned and is bad. Actually, it means that when there are Islamic rules, I will accept, you are a Muslim and will accept, all the people of Afghanistan are Muslims and they will accept. We cannot say that we obey laws or not. We do. This has been mentioned in Islamic jurisprudence. The companion that you are mentioning is a Sharia (legal) term. A woman cannot travel without a companion. Of course, the conditions for travel have been explained. If in a place where the environment is fair, women are protected and safe, then there isn’t a need for a companion. If not, if there is danger, a companion is a need. These are Sharia principles. We cannot change them. You cannot change them. The Islamic system is implementing them. 
TOLOnews: As the last question. What is your choice, Mr. Mujahid? War or peace? Will you continue war or return to the negotiations table? 
 
Mujahid: We have two ways (options). Negotiation is our priority. Negotiations and understanding. It is a priority and it is what we prefer. And, if needed, if we faced challenges once again, if we face hurdles, if we face a time of killing like we faced during the 16 months, then we will be obliged to select the second option, which is war. 
 
TOLOnews: Mr. Zabihullah Mujahid, Taliban spokesman, thank you.  
 
Mujahid: Thank you for the opportunity and for your patience.

Saleh Calls for Nation’s ‘Full Support’ of ANDSF
","
As territory in some provinces continues to fall to the Taliban, First Vice President Amrullah Saleh said on Monday that the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces’ respect among the people has not dwindled despite the evidence of some gaps in recent weeks. 
Saleh said in a Facebook post that Afghans should be proud of the security forces, saying “their sacrifice is our dignity.” 
Saleh said the Taliban are fighting for mixed interests and that the rule of the group in Afghanistan is not possible, even if they gain more territory. 
He went on to explain the reasons behind what he called recent gaps in the security forces by saying that there are many factors and a main issue is that the assessment of deployed forces is lacking, and there was a weak presence in hundreds of areas instead of a strong presence in few places. 
Saleh asks everyone not to be influenced by propaganda, saying “the enemy’s forces are divided into three parts: those directly trained by Pakistani military and directed from Peshawar, Quetta and other areas; those who are local forces and are commanded by a military commission; and those who have been recently recruited and have no morale.” 
Moreover, he said the Afghan forces have more sniper rifles than the Taliban. “What we have in excess are better and more modern than those handed over to the Taliban by the Pakistani army,” he said.
Saleh mentioned that the withdrawal of foreign forces created a sudden gap and that some of the changes were expected. “Our main focus is on maintenance so that later we can take the next steps for removing the enemy,” he added. 
He reiterated that Afghanistan needs agile forces instead of a large number of forces and “we are moving forward towards this goal speedily.” 
He also mentioned that his assessments are underway on reasons for the fall of areas and about those who had a role in it. He said those who left their bases cannot forge their identities. 
Saleh also vowed full support to those forces and civilian workers who show “bravery” and that their improvement will never be impeded by bureaucracy.
“The Afghan military forces are really national. Visit bases, and hospitals. We should be proud of these forces. Their sacrifice and bravery are our honor,” Saleh said. “We should not spare any effort in the elimination of the enemy.”

Taliban Have ‘Every Reason’ to Return to Talks: UK Military Chief
","
The UK Chief of the Defense Staff General Sir Nick Carter said in an interview with the BBC that the Taliban have got every reason to return to the talks and that a majority of the people in Afghanistan do not want the group to govern, while reiterating a call for unity among political leaders in the country.
Talking to the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show, Carter said, “The Taliban have got every reason to come to the table because 60% of Afghanistan are other ethnicities than Pashtuns and they don’t want the Taliban there so there has got to be a negotiated settlement ultimately if the country is going to be governed as a whole country.”
“The key political players in Kabul at the moment have got to show unity because if they show unity, and if the government continues to hold on to the provincial capitals and particularly Kabul as I described then that’s going to bring the Taliban to the table,” he added.
He said that it is too early to say what will happen once the withdrawal of foreign forces are completed. However, he added that there are three scenarios at the moment: “The current government couldn’t fight on as it’s doing at the moment without support from NATO troops… Secondly, there is a risk that the state could fracture and you could end up with different ethnicities breaking the country up as they did in the 1990s… And the third more helpful scenario is that you are going to press for compromise and of course the longer the Afghan government retains the provincial capitals that it is still retaining, the more likely that scenario is to play out.”
He commended the Afghan government’s current strategy to keep provincial centers.
“What I would say is that the Afghan government is pursuing a very sensible strategy of consolidation. At the moment they are not going to fight for every rural area because they don’t need to; what they need to do is to retain provincial capitals… And therefore, control the majority of the population who are now increasingly urbanized.”
He said the challenge faced by the Taliban is: “Can they govern as much of those rural areas as they have now got?”
He said that the Taliban’s credibility could be easily undermined if they are unable to govern these territories.

Gen. McKenzie Takes Charge of Remaining US Forces in Afghanistan
","
Marine Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie took charge of the remaining US forces in Afghanistan during a ceremony in Kabul on Monday.
The command of the forces was handed to him from Gen. Austin S. Miller who served in the post since 2018.
Addressing the ceremony, Gen. Miller said that achieving peace has become hard as the violence remains high. He called on the Taliban to immediately reduce violence so that there is progress in talks.
“The people of Afghanistan will be in my heart and on my mind for the rest of my life.” He called the post “the highlight of my military career.”
“Our job now is not to forget” those who sacrificed here, he said.
McKenzie takes the responsibility as the US and NATO’s military presence in the country will end within the next two months. The new mission is ""US Forces Afghanistan Forward"" involving those troops who will remain in the country to protect diplomats after the US military drawdown ends next month. 
“The violence is taking place across the country, but we know that with that violence, it works very difficult to achieve as a political settlement,” Miller said. “So again, what I tell the Taliban is they’re responsible too. The violence that’s going on is against the will of the Afghan people. And it needs to stop.”
Gen. McKenzie meanwhile pledged the US’s continued support for Afghan forces.
“While drawdown continues and will be ended by the end of August ... United States commitment to support the Afghan government and its armed forces carries on,” he said.
“Some gaps that have emerged after the withdrawal of foreign forces, these gaps are being filled and we are addressing the areas in need,” National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib said.
Last week, US President Joe Biden said that the United States military presence in Afghanistan will end on August 31.
On July 2 the US Defense Department’s press secretary John Kirby said that the new Kabul-based command will be led by Rear Adm. Peter Vasely, and those troops will help with security requirements at the Hamid Karzai International Airport there.
The force will also offer “continued advice and assistance to Afghan national defense and security forces” and support counterterrorism efforts, Kirby said.
“(McKenzie) will continue to exercise authority over the conduct of any and all counterterrorism operations needed to protect the homeland from threats emanating out of Afghanistan, and he will lead efforts to develop options for the logistical, financial and technical support to Afghan forces once our drawdown is complete,” Kirby said.

Taliban Intensifies Attacks on Ghazni City, Kandahar City
","
The Taliban has intensified attacks on Ghazni city and Kandahar city, both provincial capitals, in the last 10 days, raising concerns among some MPs and residents who warn that the provincial centers will fall to the Taliban if the government does not focus efforts to push back the attacks.
Multiple sources on Monday said that Kahmard district in Bamiyan and Garmsir district in Helmand have fallen to the Taliban in the last 24 hours. However, the Defense Ministry said that 271 Taliban fighters were killed in Afghan forces operations in the same period. The Taliban has rejected these figures.
Special forces units started an operation in Dand district and have pledged to retake the areas that have fallen to the Taliban. 
“There isn’t any specific issue here. The enemy is very far from here,” said Mujahir Mohammad, a special forces member.
“The highway and the areas and districts that have been captured for propaganda reasons will be taken back soon,” said a special forces member.
According to officials and other sources, clashes are underway in districts 5, 6, 7, 13 and 15 in the city of Kandahar.
“The Mirwais Hospital in Kandahar is full of martyrs and the wounded,” Kandahar resident Sediqullah said.
“The situation is very bad. People have been displaced from their homes,” said Kandahar resident Samiullah. 
A lawmaker from Kandahar accused the government of not paying attention to the situation in the province.
“The fall of Kandahar means the fall of all Afghanistan. Favoritism in appointments in Kandahar has led to the fall of districts and now the fight has reached the city,” said Khalil Ahmad Mujahid, an MP from Kandahar.
Information from local sources indicates that clashes are underway between government forces and the Taliban in districts 2, 3 and 5 in the city of Ghazni.
“The recent rise in insecurity is restricting the government’s control every day,” Ghazni resident Sabir said.
“The clashes have reached the city of Ghazni and we have lost almost 50 percent of the city,” said the head of Ghazni’s provincial council Nasir Ahmad Faqiri.
However, the government pledged that the Taliban attacks will be pushed back.
“If you think that you will continue this war for another 20 years--if you do this, another foreign force will come to the country,” presidential adviser Ibrahim Alokozai said.

MPs: Govt Policy on Public Forces 'Suddenly Changed'
","
Lawmakers and members of political parties said that the government’s policy toward public uprising forces has suddenly changed as it does not want to provide financial and military support to those who have taken up arms against the Taliban. 
The public forces were formed in various provinces, mostly in the north, after the fall of territory to the Taliban. The public forces said the government should provide them with military equipment and financial support.
“The people of Afghanistan have fought for 40 years and have weapons, too. Now, they have picked up guns to protect their dignity and life. They have even purchased weapons,” said former mujahedeen commander Mohammad Ismail Khan.
“There is morale in the districts where there are a large number of public forces, but they lack military equipment,” said Fatima Kohistani, an MP from Ghor. 
Two analysts said that the government has stopped support for public uprising forces even as the Taliban threat remains.
“The government called the loss of districts a tactical retreat, but these districts were handed over one after another to keep the public uprising forces at a level that cannot fight the Talibs,” said Rahmatullah Bezhanpoor, a university lecturer. 
“The government has lost useful opportunities for peace and I think that it has not sent equipment and weapons to them,” an MP from Badakhshan Waqif Hakimi said. 
However, the government has made statements about its support for the public uprising forces without giving details.
“The public uprising forces have been provided the required support. Don’t ask for information from me. Some issues are not appropriate to talk about,” said senior presidential adviser Waheed Omer at a press briefing on Monday. 
 
“The National Security Council, Ministries of Defense and Interior, as well as the NDS, are working together to organize the forces, do the biometric registration and address all problems in this respect,” said the head of the government’s media and information center Dawa Khan Minapal.

Karzai: Meaningful Peace Talks Will Resume Soon
","
Former President Hamid Karzai on Tuesday said that meaningful peace talks are expected to resume soon, but he reiterated that the Afghan government and the Taliban should not lose the current opportunity for reconciliation.
“You will soon witness the resumption of meaningful peace negotiations,” Karzai said at a press conference, calling on the people to not lose hope and to remain in the country. “Have patience, have plans, and move toward peace.”
The former president said the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan has deep roots in world powers' interference for the last two centuries.
“We called the Taliban brothers repeatedly and we were criticized for this… What has been built in Afghanistan in the last 20 years, the institutions that were built, all belong to the people of Afghanistan, not foreigners… Don’t destroy roads, bridges and institutions,” Karzai said, urging the group to show a willingness for peace. “To the Taliban, I would say that you will not gain anything by taking over districts.”
“And I call on the Afghan government not to waste the opportunities for peace; make efforts and get to the peace negotiations and create a national government through peace,” Karzai said. “I say to both sides that you are the owners of this soil, sit with each other, make peace and save the country from this situation.”
Karzai said the current situation is temporary. “The conflict is a stranger’s conflict. The solution to this conflict is through unity and peace,” he added.
Karzai also called on Afghans to have faith in themselves, remain in the country and free themselves from fear.
“Today, I am here especially to remove your fear that I hear in the media. This is immortal soil, and it will stand on its own. And we have proved it. We should have confidence,” Karzai added.
“We, the people of Afghanistan, should know the value of our soil and make demands based on that,” Karzai said. “Afghanistan is a country for which world powers are in need and we should deal with the world with confidence.”
In response to a question about Turkey's role in Kabul airport security, Karzai says Turkey is a friend to Afghanistan and that he hopes Afghanistan will witness “good days” through its cooperation with Turkey.
He said that individuals cannot decide on who will run the country.
“The leadership of the country and decisions about a (future) government in the country is not in any individual’s authority; it belongs to the will of the Afghan nation,” Karzai said. “It is done through the Afghan nation’s will. We will accept anyone’s leadership on the condition that the will of every individual in Afghanistan is part of it.”
Karzai also mentioned the freedom of the press as one of the biggest achievements of Afghanistan in the last 20 years.

Russia Opposes Possible US Military Deployment in Central Asia
","
Russia stated its opposition to a possible plan by the United States to deploy its troops in Central Asia countries once it pulls out its troops from Afghanistan on August 31, which will also mark the end of two decades of military engagement in Afghanistan.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the presence of over 100,000 US and NATO forces in Afghanistan in the past decades did not result in a victory for the US in Afghanistan, and questioned what the US wants to achieve by deploying fewer numbers of troops outside.
“Separate from the collective security treaty, there are some indications that the Pentagon officials are trying to transfer their resources along (in neighboring regions) of Afghanistan in order to attack Afghanistan if needed,” said the Russian foreign minister.
He said that a US military presence in Central Asia will not be helpful for regional security.
Nevertheless, the Afghan Ministry of Defense has said that international cooperation with Afghanistan is a must to help the nation combat global terrorism. 
“There is also a need for an international campaign to combat international terrorism in Afghanistan, cooperation by other countries with Afghanistan’s government will not pose any threat against a third nation,” said Rohullah Ahmadzai, a spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense. 
Meanwhile, former US ambassador to Afghanistan Ronald Neumann said that the US military bases in the region will be built to support the Afghan National Securiyt and Defense Forces (ANDSF).
“The bases were very useful for supporting the Afghan forces and not having bases makes it harder to support the Afghan forces, but there was never an American policy that we wanted bases permanently,” said former US ambassador to Kabul Ronald Neumann.

Forces Led by Ex-Jihadi Positioned in Herat to Fight Taliban
","
People's Resistance Front’ forces led by Mohammad Ismail Khan, an ex-Jihadi leader, have been deployed alongside security forces in some parts of Herat city to prevent the Taliban from entering the city. 
Armed with light and heavy weapons, the forces warn the Taliban that they will be killed if they get closer to the city of Herat.
Mohammad Ismail Khan says the Resistance Front forces are coordinating their activities with security agencies.
“The government is busy with ensuring security and peace to protect people and the country. To prevent any clash between security forces and the People Resistance Front forces, and to be able to jointly defend the city of Herat, we mutually coordinate things,” said Mohammad Ismail Khan, the leader of the People's Resistance Front.
Sayed Ahmad, a member of the People's Resistance Front, said: “Until the last drop of blood, we are going to defend our country, our people, and our city with high morale.”
Abdul Shakur, another member of the People's Resistance Front, said: “Under no circumstances will we allow the Taliban to enter Herat city. We assure our people that they can continue their normal life.”
The role of the public forces in ensuring security and preventing the Taliban from advancing in Herat is considered vital by the Afghan government and residents of the province.
“After the formation of the people’s mobilization against the Taliban, there has been partial security in Herat city. Compared to last week, the security situation is better now and people’s life has come back to normal,” said Maroof Herawi, a resident of Herat province.
“We need people’s help, cooperation, and support to ensure a lasting security,” said Eraj Faqiri, a resident of Herat.
Hassan Majrooh, who is a military analyst, said: “If the people's mobilization would have a regular and systematic organization and management, and perform activities based on regular leadership and orders--and would not be under any personal orders--it can be very effective in defending the country and the people.”
Meanwhile, security officials in Badghis say Taliban attacks on Qala-e-Naw city have diminished, and security forces have reduced Taliban threats by establishing a security belt around the city.
“The Taliban once again launched multiple attacks on the temporary checkpoints on one of the security belts around the city of Herat, but security forces pushed back these attacks. The Taliban feared lots of casualties,” said Shir Aqa Alokozai, the police chief of Badghis district.
As the Taliban has taken large swathes of territory in the western part of the country, hundreds of residents of Herat province have been mobilized against the Taliban fighters.

Ghani: Security Situation Will Improve in 3 Months
","
As most of the northern provinces are witnessing heavy clashes between government forces and the Taliban, President Ghani said during a visit to Balkh province that ""the Taliban’s backbone will be broken"" and all areas captured by the group will be retaken soon. 
President Ghani visited Balkh province on Tuesday to review the northern provinces' security situation and said that the security situation across the country will improve significantly in the next three months.
President Ghani's trip to Balkh comes as heavy clashes are underway between government forces and Taliban in most of the northern provinces, including Balkh.
During the trip President Ghani met with a number of civil society activists, women's rights activists, and journalists, and stressed the need for national cohesion and unity in the country.
“The Afghan government's plan to stabilize the whole situation is still in effect. The president had a meeting with the youth, women, Ulema, and teachers moments ago, and the details we have about it--about economic and security issues--will be shared soon,” said Fazel Mahmoud Fazli, head of the Administrative Office of the President.
In the last month the capitals of 9 districts of Balkh province fell to the Taliban and the Taliban got closer to the gates of Mazar-e-Sharif, the center of Balkh.
Following the escalation of Taliban attacks in Balkh, residents of the province took up arms to support the defense and security forces in fighting against the Taliban militants.
Mohammad Farhad Azimi, the governor of Balkh, said: “A delegation from the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Interior, the National Directorate of Security and also from the Security Council accompany him on this trip.”
He added: “They will discuss and exchange views on a better security plan for the protection of Hairatan Crossing and other lost districts as well.”
With the president's visit to Balkh, the city of Mazar-e-Sharif became semi-closed, and the roads leading to Balkh province were blocked. Residents of Mazar-e-Sharif criticized the road closures, saying they had faced many problems.
Abdul Qayyum, a resident of Mazar-e-Sharif, said: “They are welcome but roads in Mazar-e-Sharif city and in the rest of the province are closed to traffic and people. Instead of giving us bread and water, they took it from us.”
Khairullah, one of the drivers in Mazar-e-Sharif, said that if he met the president he would say to him: “You are the president, will you find a piece of bread for us or you would take the bread from us, the bread that costs us the callouses on our hands?""
President Ghani assured the people of Afghanistan that the security situation in the country will improve within the next three months.

UN Agency Warns of Humanitarian Crisis in Afghanistan
","
The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has warned over a looming humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan due to ongoing violence in the country. 
An estimated 270,000 Afghans have been newly displaced inside the country since January 2021 – primarily due to insecurity and violence –  bringing the total uprooted population to over 3.5 million. 
UNHCR reported that the families forced to flee their homes in recent weeks cite the worsening security situation as the predominant reason for their flight.
In addition to ongoing fighting, displaced civilians have told UNHCR and partners of incidents of extortion by non-state armed groups and the presence of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) on major roads.  
Many have reported interruptions to social services and a loss of income due to rising insecurity. 
The number of civilian casualties has risen 29 percent during the first quarter of this year compared to 2020, according to UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, UNHCR says. An increasing proportion of women and children were among those targeted.   
The needs of those who have had to flee suddenly are acute. UNHCR and partners, as part of a coordinated response, are assisting newly displaced Afghans with emergency shelter, food, health, water and sanitation support and cash assistance, despite challenges in accessing vulnerable groups. 
UNHCR says that the resilience of the Afghan people has been pushed to the limit by prolonged conflict, high levels of displacement, the impact of COVID-19, recurrent natural disasters, including drought, and deepening poverty. Some 65 per cent of the Afghan population – in and outside of Afghanistan – are children and young people. 
A failure to reach a peace agreement in Afghanistan and stem the current violence will lead to further displacement within the country, as well as to neighbouring countries and beyond, the UN organization says.
Iran and Pakistan host nearly 90 percent of displaced Afghans - more than two million registered Afghan refugees in total, according to the UNHCR.
Both countries have granted access to territory and protection to Afghan refugees, along with health and educational services through national systems. Their hospitality and inclusive policies, spanning decades and generations, must not be taken for granted, it says.
UNHCR urges the international community to step up support to the Afghan government and people of Afghanistan and its neighbours at this critical moment, in a spirit of solidarity and burden-sharing. 
UNHCR’s financial appeal for the Afghanistan situation (including operations for Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran) remains acutely underfunded, at only 43 percent of a total US$ 337 million required. 
This comes as the Afghan government and the United Nations have assessed that Afghanistan needs $953 million for humanitarian assistance and $200 million to $250 million for development programs.
The assessment, called “Joint Humanitarian Appeal,” says that over 18 million people in Afghanistan are in need of humanitarian assistance due to conflicts, coronavirus and drought.
The United Nations and the Ministry of Finance asked international donors to provide the assistance.

UN Decries 'Serious Human Rights Abuses' in Afghanistan
","
The United Nations in Afghanistan in a statement on Wednesday said it is ""increasingly concerned"" with the number of reported serious human rights abuses and violations alleged in communities most affected by the ongoing military offensive across the country.
The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said:
“The reports of killing, ill-treatment, persecution and discrimination are widespread and disturbing, creating fear and insecurity,” it said, adding that “those who carry out any such acts must be held accountable.” 
The statement specifically mentioned the reported harm to women and girls:
""UN reiterates that parties are obliged to respect the human rights and dignity of all Afghans, especially those of women and girls who have in the past been subjected to particularly acute forms of discrimination."" 
Joining other international and Afghan voices, the UN again called for peace:
""The best way to end harm to civilians is for peace talks to be re-invigorated in order for a negotiated settlement to be reached.""
The statement also referenced the protection of infrastructure, as Taliban fighters have been destroying government buildings in their attacks on district centers in the country.
""Those genuinely interested in the future of Afghanistan and its people should prioritize negotiating a peace and committing to measures, including safeguarding the country’s infrastructure, that will show a real concern for the welfare of all Afghans,"" according to the statement. 
“All parties are urged to announce an Eid ceasefire that can give Afghans a respite from the conflict and that may contribute to sustained and meaningful peace negotiations,” it added.

The foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) on Wednesday called for an end to violence in Afghanistan against civilians and the authorities and urged the Afghan government to strengthen its position for the sake of stability.
In a statement, quoted by Reuters, the SCO foreign ministers called for a purely peaceful settlement. 
Tajikistan is presiding over the organization this year and will host a meeting of the SCO Heads of State Council in September.
""A month ago, we marked a momentous date — the 20th anniversary of the SCO’s establishment. Over the past period of time, the organization has successfully travelled the path of its establishment and took a prominent place among international institutions. Our organization considers a whole range of issues on its agenda — from politics and security to economic and humanitarian cooperation,"" Tajikistan's President Emomali Rahmon said as quoted by TASS.
Also, India on Wednesday called on members of the SCO to act against terrorism and terror financing during a meeting in the Tajikistan capital that was dominated by the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan, Hindustan Times reported.

“Afghanistan, public health and economic recovery are pressing issues. Combating terrorism and extremism is the key purpose of SCO. Must stop terror financing and deter digital facilitation,” Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said in a tweet after addressing the meeting. 
Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said that stability and peace in Afghanistan has a clear effect on regional security in the SCO space.  
“As a shared responsibility, Pakistan has played its part in facilitating an Afghan led and owned peace process,” Qureshi said. “We stand ready to craft deeper partnerships with SCO states to reinforce efforts for sustainable peace.”  
“It is essential to ensure that mistakes of the past are not repeated, and that sustained efforts are made for the eradication of terrorism and extremism in all forms and manifestations from the region. Peace is strongly underpinned by economic growth and human development for allm” Qureshi tweeted.   
Meanwhile, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) in a statement on Wednesday asked all parties to agree on ceasefire during Eid.

Afghan Police Officer Fights Taliban Alone for 18 Hours
","
An Afghan police officer, Ahmad Shah, fought the Taliban alone for 18 hours in the southern province of Kandahar and said that the Taliban are undertaking a massive propaganda campaign about the military offensives to demoralize the Afghan security forces.
Ahmad Shah and 14 other policemen were deployed at a checkpoint in the suburbs of Kandahar city when the Taliban attacked them. Ahmad Shah, who was wounded, did not surrender and resisted the Taliban for 18 hours.
Ahmad Shah was rescued after reinforcements were sent to the area. He is now in stable condition.
“I did not surrender, I did not lay down my arms and I fought back,” said Ahmad Shah.
Ahmad Shah says that war needs determination and firmness for victory to be achieved.
“The enemy is very weak. They want to frighten us through their propaganda. I learned that no one should fear the enemy in real life,” added Ahmad Shah.
“Afghanistan is a sovereign country, it has an independent army and a sovereign system, it has a Constitution, we are the guardians of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan,” said Fazel Mohammad Daudzai, a member of the Afghan Special Forces.
The Taliban launched their onslaught on Kandahar city two weeks ago.

Former US President Bush: Withdrawal is 'Mistake'
","
Former US president George W. Bush on Wednesday criticized the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and said civilians were being left to be ""slaughtered"" by the Taliban.  
""I think the consequences are going to be unbelievably bad,"" he told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle.  
""Afghan women and girls are going to suffer unspeakable harm. This is a mistake. ... They're just going to be left behind to be slaughtered by these very brutal people, and it breaks my heart,"" he said. 
In April this year, the US President Joe Biden announced that American troops will leave Afghanistan by September 11. 
NATO also announced that it would follow Biden’s announcement. Most of the 2,500 US and 7,500 NATO troops who were in Afghanistan before President Biden’s announcement have since left Afghanistan.
Following Biden’s announcement, the Taliban has escalated their attack across Afghanistan and dozens of districts have fallen to the group. 
On Monday, US Marine Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie took charge of the remaining US forces in Afghanistan during a ceremony in Kabul. 
The command of the forces was handed over to him from Gen. Austin S. Miller who served in the post since 2018.
Addressing the ceremony, Gen. Miller said that achieving peace has become hard as the violence remains high. He called on the Taliban to immediately reduce violence so that there is progress in talks. 
McKenzie takes the responsibility as the US and NATO’s military presence in the country will end within the next two months.  
The new mission is ""US Forces Afghanistan Forward"" involving those troops who will remain in the country to protect diplomats after the US military drawdown ends next month.  
The UK Chief of the Defense Staff General Sir Nick Carter said in an interview with the BBC that the Taliban have got every reason to return to the talks and that a majority of the people in Afghanistan do not want the group to govern, while reiterating a call for unity among political leaders in the country. 
Talking to the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show, Carter said, “The Taliban have got every reason to come to the table because 60% of Afghanistan are other ethnicities than Pashtuns and they don’t want the Taliban there so there has got to be a negotiated settlement ultimately if the country is going to be governed as a whole country.” 
“The key political players in Kabul at the moment have got to show unity because if they show unity, and if the government continues to hold on to the provincial capitals and particularly Kabul as I described then that’s going to bring the Taliban to the table,” he added. 
He said that it is too early to say what will happen once the withdrawal of foreign forces are completed.  
However, he added that there are three scenarios at the moment: “The current government couldn’t fight on as it’s doing at the moment without support from NATO troops… Secondly, there is a risk that the state could fracture and you could end up with different ethnicities breaking the country up as they did in the 1990s… And the third more helpful scenario is that you are going to press for compromise and of course the longer the Afghan government retains the provincial capitals that it is still retaining, the more likely that scenario is to play out.” 
He commended the Afghan government’s current strategy to keep provincial centers. 
On Wednesday, the foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) on Wednesday called for an end to violence in Afghanistan against civilians and the authorities and urged the Afghan government to strengthen its position for the sake of stability. 
In a statement, quoted by Reuters, the SCO foreign ministers called for a purely peaceful settlement.

Afghan Leaders Set to Discuss Agenda for Doha Talks
","
President Ashraf Ghani is expected to chair a key meeting of Afghanistan’s political leaders on Thursday, amid reports that an 11-member team of Afghan politicians plan to travel to Doha by the end of this week for talks with the Taliban on the peace process.
Thursday’s meeting is expected to address the agenda of the talks in Doha and the timeline for the trip.
Mohammad Karim Khalili, a member of the 11-member team, said on Wednesday that a ceasefire will be on the main agenda of the talks with the Taliban.
“We are holding discussions on the timeline, we will know about more tomorrow and there will be a clear picture,” said Mohammad Karim Khalili, a member of the team.
“We warn all warring sides not to be emboldened by war and military advancement, if this situation continues, we will witness a more fragile Afghanistan,” said Khalili.
The Taliban said that the group’s key negotiator Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar will lead the Taliban delegation in the talks with the Afghan political leaders.
Hizb-e-Islami, which is led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, has said that Hekmatyar will also participate in the meeting.
“Mr. Hekmatyar will participate in the Doha meeting along with the elders of Afghanistan to talk peace with the Taliban,” said Humayoun Jarir, a member of Hizb-e-Islami.
Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the High Council of National Reconciliation (HCNR), also said that the main objective of the trip is to bring peace to the country.
“Peace will also have its own requirements, it requires both sides to reach a settlement, we are going there (Doha) with the same spirit, but it is not possible for one side to try and take something through war and then try to seek its legitimacy in talks,” said Abdullah.
Abdullah Abdullah, Hamid Karzai, Yunus Qanooni, Karim Khalili, Mohammad Mohaqiq, Salam Rahimi, Abdul Rashid Dostum, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Sayed Sadat Mansoor Naderi, Enayatullah Baligh and Fatima Gailani are part of the team, sources said.
The meeting will follow last week’s talks in Tehran between an Afghan delegation led by former vice president Mohammad Yunus Qanooni and a Taliban delegation led by Abbas Stanekzai.
Some politicians, including former president Karzai’s close aide Abdul Karim Khurram, said the meeting was “highly constructive” during which the two sides shared recommendations with each other.

Popular Afghan singer Aryana Sayeed opened a store in Kabul on Wednesday with a fashion show of her clothing brand.
The performer said that she spent 8 million Afs (about $100,000) to create a factory to produce her products in Kabul. 
The clothing features modern designs sewn by Afghan women. The store officially opened after a fashion show with models walking a red carpet. 


 



""When we have our own products, why do we want to produce abroad? said Farzaneh Roshandel, a tailor, adding: “I am very happy, we want the government to provide us with the same facilities, we want to do a good job.” 
Aryana Sayeed and her production people have been working for almost a year to bring their clothes to the market. 
""Part of the work is done by men and part by women,” Aryana Sayeed said at the opening ceremony. “The clothes that we make are mostly focused on having an Afghan cultural style in addition to being modern.” 
“It is the women who use their art of embroidery,” she said. 



 



Aryana Sayeed

Currently, a total of ten men and women are working at the Aryana brand factory and Sheela Ahamdi is one of them.  
Sheela Ahmadi attended the opening ceremony to see the clothes that she and her colleagues worked on for months. 
""The best clothes are made by Aryana Jan. Because in Afghanistan and in such a situation, it is great for women to invest and create jobs for other women,"" she said.

Aryana Sayeed opened her brand with standards that are intended to interest international consumers.
Aryana is a singer, songwriter, and TV personality from Afghanistan. Born in  1985 in Kabul to a Pashto-speaking father and a Dari-speaking mother, Aryana left her country when she was eight years old.  
Her family migrated to Switzerland via Pakistan, and it was in choirs in her Swiss schools that Aryana realized she wanted to make a career out of singing.  
In  2008, she rose to fame with the release of her first single “MashaAllah."" After the release of her song “Afghan Pesarak”, she became a household name among Afghans.  
Since then, she has performed regularly in concerts, TV shows, and philanthropic festivals, both within and outside of Afghanistan.  
In her brief career, Aryana has already won multiple awards, including Best New Female Artist of the Year, Best Female Artist of the Year (five times), Best Live Performer, Best Song of the Year, Best Video of the Year, and Best Afghan Woman Icon. In  2013, Aryana was granted the title of “Star of Voice” (Sitara-e Aawaaz) by the International Afghan Artists Association. 
Aryana’s music videos have obtained millions of views on YouTube, and she also has the biggest following of any Afghan artist on social media. 
Her clothing launch comes amid great uncertainty within the country as foreign troops are leaving Afghanistan and the Taliban has escalated the war. Afghan women are concerned about their rights.

The clashes between the Taliban and security forces in Qala-e-Naw, capital of Badghis province, stopped on Thursday afternoon after the mediation of tribal elders, said the provincial governor, Hesamuddin Shams.
 
“With the mediation of the tribal elders, from 1:00 pm today a ceasefire has been in place,” Shams said, adding: “The Taliban has left the outskirts of the city of Qala-e-Naw and the security forces have the situation under control.” 
“We are standing by our commitments and we hope that the Taliban also respects their commitments,” he said. 
Local sources said that several parts of the city have seen damage due to the clashes between the security forces and the Taliban. 
More than 1,000 families were also displaced over the past eight days in Qala-e-Naw and moved to western Herat province and other parts of Badghis.

Q&A: Turkish Envoy Speaks of Failed Coup on 5-Year Anniversary
","
In this interview, Cihad Erginay, Ambassador of Turkey in Afghanistan, discusses issues related to the July 15, 2016, attempted coup in Turkey that was followed by various arrests by the Turkish government. The ambassador also highlights Turkey’s role in the Afghan peace process.
Q: Five years after the attempted coup in Turkey, what changes has it brought to Turkish society?
A: The heinous coup attempt has erased any possible remaining questions in the minds of the Turkish public regarding the true criminal nature of FETO and the extent to which it had infiltrated Turkish society, specifically the military and the bureaucracy. The eradication of these FETO elements from Turkish society was akin to the removal of a malignant tumor and it opened the way for a more democratic, open, confident and fair society. The Turkish nation will never forget the 251 martyrs killed and over  2,000 wounded during the terrorist group’s coup attempt on the evening of 15 July  2016, using aircraft, tanks, and other equipment hijacked from the military.
Q: Many were arrested. Some policies were changed. Turkey was shocked by the incident. How many of the tens of thousands arrested have been released and how many of them are in prison?
A: Suspected members of the terror organization have been put on trial and those who were proven to be involved in criminal activities have been charged and sentenced by the independent judiciary according to relevant penal codes. Prevalence of the rule of law dictates that as with any other criminal, those who have carried out their sentences be released.
Q: Some measures followed by the attempted coup were taken regarding Turkey’s education centers in Afghanistan. Please take us through the status of the schools in Afghanistan. There were some changes in the Afghan-Turk schools in Kabul. Have they been effective?
A: The Afghan and Turkish Governments signed an agreement regarding the handover of FETO schools in Afghanistan to the Turkish Maarif Foundation (TMF). In accordance with the agreement, TMF is not only running the schools it took over, but also opening new schools with the highest standard throughout Afghanistan. In this respect, TMF has greatly increased the range of its schools and is currently operating 20 schools across 7 provinces, serving more than  6,000 students. We attach great importance in reaching the whole of Afghanistan and have most recently opened schools in Wardak and Helmand. TMF plans to continue opening new schools across the provinces. 
 
FETO affiliated institutions still operating in Afghanistan use the name “Turkish” thereby misusing the trust Afghans put in the name and spread lies about their affiliation with Turkey. Those affiliated with FETO institutions will not be able to benefit from the high standards of education provided by TMF, not be able to study in Turkey or receive Turkey scholarships. We trust that necessary steps will be taken to put an end to the illegal activities of remaining FETO institutions. 
Q: Has your government done an assessment on the factors that led to the attempted coup?
A: Gülen is the mastermind behind what happened in Turkey on July 15 th, 2016. Gülen and his followers planned and tried to capture the Turkish Republic on that date. 
His disciples within the armed forces did not shy away from using lethal military force against innocent civilians, killing 251 and wounding thousands. They tried to assassinate the President of the Republic of Turkey. They attacked the Prime Minister’s vehicle and air-bombarded the Grand National Assembly. The Presidential Complex, the buildings of the National Intelligence Organization and Turkish National Police departments were attacked. The Police Special Operations Center, the crucial counter-terrorism operational body of Turkey in Ankara, was bombed by fighter jets, killing 55 police officers and injuring hundreds on the spot. 
Hundreds of civilians protesting the coup attempt in Ankara and Istanbul were shot to death. The FETO coup plotters targeted public and private communication outlets, including TRT (state broadcasting channel) and CNN Türk. 
All the evidence collected so far throughout the investigations and trials demonstrates that the bloodiest terrorist attack in the history of Turkey was orchestrated by FETO under the instructions of Fetullah Gülen. 
Q: Of course, every such attempt might leave an impact on a country or society. What helped Turkey to move forward from that type of temporary situation and what lessons have been learned?   
 
A: As the Turkish Government understood the true nature of FETO, the necessary legal actions were taken against it. In particular, the disclosure of their secret communication systems (ByLock, Eagle, etc.) and interceptions of FETO instructions made our efforts easier to identify their schemes and to incriminate them.  
July 15th was plotted at the time when the government had discovered and listed most of the so-called military personnel who were actually recruits of FETO and thus was getting ready to dismiss them. In other words, July 15th was a desperate final move of Fetullah Gülen and his followers to keep their control in place in Turkey and capture the state.  
The 15th of July armed coup attempt demonstrated FETO’s resolute to unwaveringly use terror, alongside other crimes, as a means to achieve its ultimate aim. With this act, FETO has clearly shown itself to the world as one of the most dangerous terrorist groups. Hence, the 16th Criminal Chamber of the Court of Cassation decreed on April 24,  2017, by its judgement merit no . 2015/3 and decision no . 2017/3 that FETO is an armed terrorist organization and the Assembly of Criminal Chambers of the Court of Cassation upheld this judgement.  
 
FETO was present in around 160 countries, with schools, businesses, NGOs and media houses. Their modus operandi is the same all around the world. As they aim to infiltrate and enlarge their global economic and political influence, they constitute a direct security threat for any country where they operate.
Q: How do you describe the Hizmet movement?
A: It all started under the guise of a charitable education effort back in the  1970s. Fetullah Gülen and his followers disguised themselves as a benign education movement, when they started the campaign of establishing schools in Turkey and later around the world. At the peak of their power, they controlled thousands of schools in Turkey and more than eight hundred educational institutes worldwide.  In terms of their reach, they were unprecedented.  
We now understand that this was the first step of an infiltration campaign where kids and their parents were recruited with the seemingly innocent promise of a better education and a good job. These kids were put through school with academic and financial help and mainly a heavy hand in indoctrination. They turned into unquestioning foot soldiers of Fetullah Gülen who claims to be the “Chosen One”. The goal was to subvert the democratic foundations of the Turkish state and establish a new anti-democratic one under the absolute rule of Gülen. His students were also told that, to achieve their main goal of taking the control of the state, they should remain hidden and they could eschew all ethical, religious or personal beliefs. Attaching great importance to confidentiality in its structure, and calling the confidentiality as a ""precaution"", the organisation gives ""code"" names to its members apart from their real names to ensure secrecy. In this way, this is a unique and peculiar armed terrorist organisation where its lower level members know each other by their code names and which has a ""cell-type"" structure.
Q: What are other accusations against this movement?
A: Currently Fetullah Gülen himself is the prime suspect in different criminal indictments.  
The recent probes into the activities of the FETO by Public Prosecutor’s Office have shown that under the banner of service, tolerance and humanitarian organizations, FETO and Fetullah Gülen have established and managed an illegal organization, exposed confidential information belonging to the state for political or military espionage purposes, violated the confidentiality of private life, conducted unlawful recording of personal information, forged official documents, fabricated criminal cases, destroyed evidence, laundered money and committed murder.
Q: Is there any reason for the Turkish government’s attempts to eradicate Gulen and his followers from Turkey’s politics?
A: To judge the deeds of Fetullah Gülen and FETO only with what transpired on July 15th would be a mistake. The crimes committed on the night of July 15th were just the tip of an iceberg.  
There were mass-scale exam cheatings as well: In order to infiltrate the critical government posts, FETO affiliated students were provided with the answers to entrance exams. There are currently many investigations into mass-scale exam cheatings in Turkey, including the Police Academy entrance tests, the Centralized Public Service Admission Tests, Military Schools and other governmental jobs.  
 
The handlers of those FETO members staffed at critical governmental posts kept their indoctrination up-to-date and passed on the instructions of FETO. As civil servants or military personnel, FETO members’ loyalty was not to the nation or to the state they served. They did not care about upholding the constitution or the legal system of the country. 
 
Thus, the organization that disguised itself as an education movement gradually turned into a secretive operational structure aiming to transform the society by taking control of the Turkish state from within.  
 
As its strength grew, the organization began to claim a global messianic mission, depicting Fetullah Gülen as the “Imam of the Universe”. 
The crime syndicate behind all this devised and ran an integrated system that took care of recruitment through schools; financing was taken care of by holding companies and donations from business people. The organization also established media houses to shape the public opinion for and against any person, group or idea. Many people in Turkey who saw the organization for what it really is got lynched through these media houses. These media houses became the focal point of actions taken against journalists, academicians, bureaucrats and military officers who opposed them, or tried to expose them. They were lynched and purged.  
As the organization became more affluent, it started meddling in business transactions and government tender processes. Laundering enormous sums of money, arranging illegal transfers of cash and other financial crimes became business as usual.  
The FETO members infiltrating critical state posts abused their power to eliminate who opposed the organization, by illegal wiretapping, fabricating evidence, unlawful arrests, thereby intimidating and blackmailing a large segment of the society including politicians, businessmen, journalists, even athletes and artists among many.   
Turkish judicial authorities rendered numerous conviction decisions against members of this crime syndicate due to its various criminal acts, some of which have been elaborated above. Thousands of investigations and prosecutions concerning the illegal activities of FETO members are still pending. The ongoing and finalised investigations, prosecutions and trials yielded that Fetullah Gülen is the administrator and ringleader of the FETO armed terrorist organisation and that he gave the order to stage the coup.
Q: And as the last question. Afghanistan is at a critical juncture given its political and security situation. What role can the Turkish government can play to help the country achieve peace and overcome the ongoing crisis?
A: Since the beginning of the Afghan Peace Process, Turkey has been expressing its readiness to support the process in any way it can. In this regard, we were ready to host the Istanbul Conference, which was postponed. Nevertheless, Turkey continues to be ready to help the process, including hosting the Istanbul Conference, but only when both sides are sincerely ready and willing to agree on solid deliverables.
The optimism around the idea of the Istanbul Conference has demonstrated the trust Afghan people put in Turkey, not only in terms of capacity, but also intentions. As a brotherly country with impressive historical and cultural ties, it is clear to Afghans that Turkey has no hidden agenda in Afghanistan and only wants her to be stable, united and prosperous.

Govt Relocates 240 Prisoners from Kandahar After Taliban Attacks
","
Following a series of six attacks by the Taliban on the central prison in the southern province of Kandahar, sources on Thursday said that the Afghan government has relocated 240 prisoners from Kandahar to Kabul.
The Afghan commandos and the special units of the Afghan National Police are currently responsible for the security of the inmates, said the sources.
Meanwhile, there are reports that the Taliban has taken over the strategic district of Arghandab in Kandahar.
Reports say that some detainees protested following the relocation.
Earlier this week the Taliban launched a series of attacks on PD6 of Kandahar city.
Afghan security authorities at the time said they had repelled the attacks.
TOLOnews correspondent Sharif Amiri reported from Kandahar city that the Afghan commandos on Thursday night launched an operation around Kandahar's main prison in PD6 to thwart another offensive by the Taliban.
“There is complete security in Kandahar, no one should be worried about it, the people should have trust in their security and defense forces,” said Mohammad Nazeer, an Afghan commando officer in Kandahar.
“The enemy has been attacking the prison for several nights, but we are here to defend and to ensure the comfort of our people,” said Sadruddin, a member of the special units of the Afghan National Police.
“We gave the enemy a harsh response,” said Noor-ul-Haq, an Afghan commando in the area.
The Taliban currently controls 12 districts in Kandahar.

Taliban Destroyed, Damaged Infrastructure in 116 Districts: IARCS
","
Ahmad Nader Nadery, the chairman of the Independent Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission (IARCSC), on Thursday said that the IARCSC findings show that in the districts recently seized by the Taliban essential government services have been halted, and a large number of civil servants have been harmed, or displaced from their areas to provincial capitals.
According to Nadery, the Taliban either torched or destroyed 260 government buildings and assets in 116 districts.
Nadery said that 13 million Afghans have been deprived of social services in the Taliban-controlled areas and 50,000 employees including women have been affected in Taliban territories.
“There are more than 13 million people living in areas and districts recently captured by the Taliban, who currently have no access to public services. In these areas, hundreds of development projects such as the reconstruction of water supply networks, roads, retaining walls, the construction of schools, bridges, hospitals, stadiums, cold storage facilities, drilling wells, etc., have been shut down. For instance, in the Taliban-controlled districts of Takhar province alone, 112 ongoing development projects have now been completely stopped,” said IARCSC chief Nader Nadery.
The Taliban has denied the allegations.
Nadery said that the damage done by the Taliban on state institutions is estimated to be around $500 million. He said that 4,000 public services employees have evacuated their native areas because of the threats of the Taliban.
“Attacks on civilian targets, including civilian infrastructure, is a clear breach of international humanitarian laws. These crimes must stop. A peaceful settlement of conflict and a shared future for our people is the only path to stop the destruction and suffering of our country and people,” said Nadery.
“In districts under Taliban control in Paktia province, only those women working in gynecology are permitted to work, but they must wear a Hijab and be accompanied by a Mahram,” said Nadery.
“As the Taliban took control of the districts, more than 50,000 civil servants are unable to perform their duties and live in an uncertain situation. Nearly 4,000 of which have either been harmed or displaced from their areas to provincial capitals due to the bad security situation and threats,” said Nadery.
Meanwhile, the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) has said that there are reports that the Taliban imposed some restrictions on the people in areas under their control over the past few weeks.
According to the AIHRC, these restrictions included a ban on women leaving the house without a proper veil and male guardian, the closure of girls schools, a ban on the delivery of health services to women who do not have male guardians, a halt to TV programs, forcing teachers and students to not shave their beards, and putting on turbans.
“Thirteen million humans, 13 million oppressed people in Afghanistan have been affected due to the actions of the Taliban,” said Nadery.
“One of the restrictions is a restriction on women, one of the restrictions is that the women cannot go out of their homes without a veil and guardian,” said Zabihullah Farhang, a spokesman for the AIHRC.
“From the day the Taliban took over our area, the women cannot go outside of their homes or to work,” said senator Fawzia Samkani.
However, the Taliban in a statement has rejected Naderi’s statement.
The Taliban in their statement said that social services including the delivery of health services, agriculture and schooling continues in their areas.

Mohaqiq Urges Negotiated Settlement to Avert Potential Civil War
","
President Ashraf Ghani's special envoy for security and political affairs Mohammad Mohaqiq on Thursday said that the Taliban, by pursuing the takeover of districts, cannot determine their full control of Afghanistan.
Mohaqiq said that winning a victory over the Taliban by military means is not possible, stating that the peace negotiations must be sped up to resolve the conflict.
Mohaqiq warned that Afghanistan will plunge into civil war if the peace process does not reach a conclusion.
“The Taliban cannot ignore the public opinion in Afghanistan and in the world toward their military advancement,” said Mohaqiq.
Meanwhile, Assadullah Saadati, the deputy head of High Council of National Reconciliation (HCNR), said that the Taliban is having a serious problem with the present system—adding that the group is still not prepared to recognize the principles of a democratic system.
Wahid Omar, a top aide to President Ashraf Ghani, said that circles within the system should not be used for the destruction of the system.
Joining Omar, Ghani’s aide Akram Khpolwak said that the Afghan peace process has entered into a decision-making phase—stating that all state institutions should be protected as a result of a potential peace agreement.
“Any temporary deal between some political parties and movement cannot bring sustainable peace,” said Akram Khpolwak, an aide to Ghani.
In addition, Pakistan’s former ambassador to the US Hussain Haqqani said that it would be best if Pakistan’s government engaged in friendly relations with Afghanistan.
“While Pakistan claims to have control over 85 percent of land in Afghanistan, their leaders and families live in Doha or in various cities in Pakistan,” said Haqqani.

Saleh: Pakistan Warning Against Attempts to Retake Spin Boldak
","
Afghanistan’s First Vice President Amrullah Saleh on Thursday said that the Pakistani air force has warned the Afghan National Army (ANA) and the Afghan Air Force that any move to dislodge the Taliban from the Spin Boldak area will be faced and repelled by the Pakistan Air Force.
“ Breaking: Pakistan air force has issued official warning to the Afghan Army and Air Force that any move to dislodge the Taliban from Spin Boldak area will be faced and repelled by the Pakistan Air Force. Pak air force is now providing close air support to Taliban in certain areas,” Saleh wrote in a Twitter post.
This comes two days after Taliban fighters claimed that they had seized control of the Spin Boldak crossing area between Afghan and Pakistan territory.
Spin Boldak crossing is one of the key strategic locations in Kandahar province, which is adjacent to Pakistan.
Video released by the Taliban on social media showed the group's white flag flying in place of the Afghanistan’s national flag above the Friendship Gate.
This new development takes place as Pakistan has announced that it will hold a peace conference on Afghanistan in the coming days.
The meeting was originally scheduled on July 17. But it was postponed due to a trip by prominent Afghan political leaders to Doha where they are set to meet with Taliban leaders about ending the current conflict.
The Taliban recently seized some other major border crossings, in Herat, Farah and Kunduz provinces.

Kandahar Airstrike ‘Aborted’ Over Pakistan’s Warning: Sources
","
Sources say that an operation by three A29 aircraft of the Afghan Air Force on Taliban targets in Spin Boldak, Kandahar, on Thursday, was aborted after “receiving warning” from Pakistan’s forces.
A conversation a copy of which was sent to TOLOnews by government sources shows that Afghan Air Force was warned that they are getting “closer to the border,” but an Afghan military official claims that they were warned not to get closer as much as 18 kilometers to the international border point in Chaman and Spin Boldak.
A military analyst said that military aircraft should not get as close as 10 nautical miles (18.5 kilometers) to another country’s border when conducting an operation based on international laws.
This comes as First Vice President Amrullah Saleh in a tweet on Thursday said that “Pakistan air force has issued an official warning to the Afghan Army and Air Force that any move to dislodge the Taliban from Spin Boldak area will be faced and repelled by the Pakistan Air Force.”
He said that “Pakistan air force is now providing close air support to Taliban in certain areas.”
But Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a statement said that it rejects “allegations” by First Vice President Amrullah Saleh and says it took ""necessary measures within its territory to safeguard our own troops and population.""
“The Afghan side conveyed to Pakistan its intention of carrying out air operation inside its territory opposite Chaman Sector of Pakistan. Pakistan responded positively to the Afghan Government’s right to act in its territory,” the ministry said.
It added: “In spite of very close border operations normally not acceded to by internationally accepted norms/standards/procedures, Pakistan took necessary measures within its territory to safeguard our own troops and population.”
“We acknowledge Afghan Government’s right to undertake actions on its sovereign territory,” the statement said. “However, as alleged by the Afghan Vice President, Pakistan Air Force never communicated anything to the Afghan Air Force. Such statements undermine Pakistan’s sincere efforts to play its part in an Afghan-owned and Afghan-led solution.”
In response to the statement by the Pakistani government, Saleh in a tweet called the statement “a statement of denial” and “a pre-written paragraph.”
This also comes two days after Taliban fighters claimed that they had seized control of the Spin Boldak crossing area between Afghan and Pakistan territory.

Ghani at Int’l Summit Blasts Pakistan for ‘Supporting’ Taliban
","
President Ashraf Ghani at an international summit in Uzbekistan on Friday criticized Pakistan for what he called support to the Taliban, calling on the neighboring country to use its influence and leverage for peace and cessation of hostilities in Afghanistan.
“Intelligence estimates indicate the influx of over 10,000 jihadi fighters from Pakistan and other places in the last month, as well as, support from their affiliates and the transnational terrorist organizations,” President Ghani said at the summit named “Central and South Asia: Regional Connectivity, Challenges and Opportunities.”
“Contrary to the repeated assurances by Prime Minister Khan and his generals that Pakistan does not find a Taliban take over in Afghanistan in Pakistan’s interest, and assured of its use of force will use its power to influence to make the Taliban negotiate seriously, networks and organizations supporting the Taliban are openly celebrating the destruction of assets and capabilities of the Afghan people and state,” he said.
President Ghani said that there is a consensus among credible international observers that the Taliban has not taken any steps to sever their relationship with terrorist organizations. 
“Contrary to the declarations of their political office that they will not attack cities and provincial centers they are accelerating their attacks and attempting to starve the cities,” Ghani said, referring to recent attacks by Taliban.
“We are prepared to face the Taliban and their supporters for as long as it takes until they realize that a political solution is the only way forward,” he said. “We, therefore, call on the Taliban to engage with the government of Afghanistan to end the war and the destructive recent onslaught.”
Ghani asked the region for “sense of urgency,” adding, “Lessons learnt are clear. Without regional consensus, and support peace does not break out.”
“To plunge Afghanistan into all-out war is to plunge the region into radical uncertainty. Pakistan, therefore, needs to be engaged coherently and urgently from the perspective of regional interest,” he concluded.
On the sidelines of this conference, President Ghani met with Uzbek president, a US delegation and the Pakistani prime minister.

As clashes continue in various provinces, the Defense Ministry said on Friday that Afghan National Defense and Security Forces retook the control of Saighan and Kahmard districts in Bamiyan and Chakhansur district in Nimroz in the last 24 hours.  
“In an operation that began this morning, districts were retaken in a short time by security forces, and the country's flag was raised back on the districts,” Bamiyan governor Tahir Zuhair said.
The Ministry of Defense said the operations by Afghan security forces are underway to push back the Taliban attacks on cities and to retake the areas that are under Taliban influence.

Dostum Urges Govt to Support Local Forces Under His Command
","
Former vice president Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum on Friday urged the central government to ensure the delivery of sufficient support and equipment to public uprising forces under his command in the fight against the Taliban.
Talking to a gathering of his supporters via phone, Dostum said the government so far has not provided sufficient support to these forces.
Dostum also persuaded the Taliban to return to negotiations and said they should not get excited by taking over districts.
“The morale of the boys is very high,” said Dostum, referring to the forces under his command.
“Unfortunately, poor management of the war has led to this situation,” said Dostum, referring to fall of distircts.
He also expressed his dismay over what he described it government’s unwillingness to hear his military advices.
The National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan party led by Dostum organized a gathering in Kabul where speakers urged the government to provide sufficient aid to public uprising forces.
“When the Taliban firstly appeared in the northern part of the country, their presence was not too much strong in villages and vicinities and cities, they should have been suppressed at the time, because they had not a good spirit for war,” said Kanishka Turkistani, a member of the National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, Ata Mohammad Noor, head of the splinter faction of Hizb-e-Islami and former governor of Balkh, announced the formation of a command center for public forces under his command and urged them to avoid commuting inside the city.
“You shouldn’t interfere into the affairs of the people, their legal and judicial issues, avoid walking around in the city, stay in your bases, you will be asked for service whenever there is a need for,” Noor told his fighters.

A high-ranking delegation from the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan led by Chairman Abdullah Abdullah and a Taliban delegation led by deputy leader of the group Abdul Ghani Baradar started negotiations on peace with the hope to agree on key issues that will lead to political settlement and end of violence in the country.
The meeting is hosted by Qatar where the republic and Taliban negotiators have continued their talks for the last 10 months, but their meetings have not had tangible progress so far.
Former vice president Mohammad Karim Khalili, Ata Mohammad Noor, Batur Dostum Salam Rahimi, and Sayed Saadat Mansoor Naderi are part of the Afghan republic’s delegation.
Addressing the opening ceremony of peace talks in Doha, Abdullah Abdullah, head of the High Council for National Reconciliation, said Afghans are passing through difficult days, heavy clashes are underway and the main victims are the people.
Abdullah says that comprehensive meetings were held between Afghan politicians and the government leaders ahead of the Doha meeting and all had one message: Afghanistan’s problem has no military solution.
He said that all efforts should be focused on ending the war and achieving a political settlement.
To achieve peace, there is a need for flexibility from both sides, Abdullah said.

Baradar said that to ensure Afghanistan’s prosperity, there is a need for a central and independent Islamic system and to achieve this, “we should ignore our personal interests.”
Reiterating on unity among Afghans, Baradar said Afghanistan is a common home for all Afghans and that “we should ignore details if we want to achieve bigger goals.”
“We should end lack of trust and should make efforts for the nation’s unity,” Baradar added.

President Ghani’s Bold Stance on Pakistan Sparks Reactions
","
President Ashraf Ghani’s recent speech at the “Central and South Asia: Regional Connectivity, Challenges and Opportunities” in Uzbekistan in which he criticized Pakistan for what he called support to the Taliban has sparked widespread reactions from analysts in the country some of whom say it will affect the peace efforts.
Some analysts believe that in the view of Pakistan’s strong influence and leverage on the Taliban, it would be appropriate to deal with Pakistan through dialogue to end the prevailing conflict in the country while some others have hailed Ghani’s position and say that Pakistan had never been a trusted partner when it comes towards efforts to end the conflict in Afghanistan.
“Pakistan so far has failed to cooperate with generosity and truthfulness because Pakistan is in pursuit of its own interests in terms of cooperation, therefore it will not allow Afghanistan to move towards security and peace unless it determines its interests there,” said MP Ibdalullah Mohammadi.
“We must consult the UN, US, UK and all those countries who are the permanent members of the UN, the Afghan conflict must be resolved in an international level,” said political analyst Hekmatullah Shahbaz.
Ordinary Afghans believe that mounting international pressure on Pakistan is the only way to convince Islamabad to endorse peace in Afghanistan.
“It will be good if leaders from both countries work together for peace in Afghanistan,” said Naseer Ahmad Naseri, a resident of Kabul.
In his speech on Friday, Ghani called on the neighboring country to use its influence for peace and cessation of hostilities in Afghanistan.
“Intelligence estimates indicate the influx of over 10,000 jihadi fighters from Pakistan and other places in the last month, as well as, support from their affiliates and the transnational terrorist organizations,” President Ghani said at the summit named “Central and South Asia: Regional Connectivity, Challenges and Opportunities.”
At the same event, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran rejected Ghani’s remarks by saying that Islamabad was never against the ongoing instability in Afghanistan.
Khan said that Pakistan has contributed massively than any other nation when it comes to a political settlement in Afghanistan.
“Let me to say that the country that is going to be most affected by turmoil in Afghanistan is Pakistan. Pakistan suffered 70,000 people dead in the last 15 years,” Khan said. “I can assure you that no country has tried harder to get Taliban on the dialogue table than Pakistan.""
Over the past two decades, authorities in Afghanistan have often complained about Pakistan’s controversial role in the peace process in Afghanistan, something Islamabad has dismissed as baseless.

Afghans Will Never Allow Taliban to Achieve Its Goals: Mohammadi
","
Acting Minister of Defense Gen. Bismillah Mohammadi on Saturday said that the Afghan people and the government will not allow the Taliban to takeover the country through military pressure.
He said that losing territory during the war is a natural phenomenon, but territory never determines the fate of the conflict.
“The Taliban will not reach to their goals through violence. They only add to the pain and suffering of our people. But they will not reach to their evil goal. We are fully committed to defend Afghanistan,” said Mohammadi.
Mohammadi made the remarks during the graduation ceremony of 135 Afghan Special Force members in Kabul. The new officers will soon be deployed to the frontlines.
“We will not allow anyone to rule our country and soil until we are alive,” said a newly Special Force graduate Sayed Tawala.
“The Afghan people must be assured,” said Sakina, a Special Force officer.
The graduation comes at a time that the Taliban have taken over 200 districts in the past two months.
“Losing territory or a geography during war is a normal thing. Everyone knows that territory is being exchanged during the war, but it does not determine the main thing,” said Mohammadi.

Russia Offered US Use of Central Asia Bases: Report
","
Russian President Vladimir Putin in June offered US counterpart Joe Biden the use of Russian military bases in Central Asia for information gathering from Afghanistan, Reuters reported quoting the Kommersant newspaper report from Saturday. 
The Reuters report says that Putin proposed at June 16 talks with Biden in Geneva that they coordinate on Afghanistan and put Russia's bases in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan to ""practical use"", Kommersant reported, citing sources.
The newspaper said this could involve the exchange of information obtained using drones but that there had been no concrete response from the US side.
Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday said the US and NATO alliance withdrawal from Afghanistan made the political and military situation more uncertain, which in turn exacerbated the insurgent’s threat in the region. 
Speaking at a conference with senior Central Asian officials in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, Lavrov said Russia wanted to help kickstart peace talks between the warring sides in Afghanistan. 
A week ago, Russia stated its opposition to a possible plan by the United States to deploy its troops in Central Asia countries once it pulls out its troops from Afghanistan on August 31, which will also mark the end of two decades of military engagement in Afghanistan. 
Lavrov said that the presence of over 100,000 US and NATO forces in Afghanistan in the past decades did not result in a victory for the US in Afghanistan and questioned what the US wants to achieve by deploying fewer numbers of troops outside. 
“Separate from the collective security treaty, there are some indications that the Pentagon officials are trying to transfer their resources along (in neighboring regions) of Afghanistan in order to attack Afghanistan if needed,” said the Russian foreign minister. 
He said that a US military presence in Central Asia will not be helpful for regional security. 
Nevertheless, the Afghan Ministry of Defense has said that international cooperation with Afghanistan is a must to help the nation combat global terrorism.  
The US military mission in Afghanistan is coming to its end on August 31 as mentioned by President Joe Biden.

He mentioned the Taliban's takeover of districts but said the group's support for a political solution is ""serious."" 
The Taliban leader also said that the group would take advantage of any opportunity that would result in the establishment of an Islamic system and peace and security in the country.  
Akhundzada said the group is committed to resolving issues through dialogue, but he accused the Afghan government of wasting time in the peace talks.
He also said that the Taliban wants “good, strong diplomatic, economic and political relations” with the world, and he assured neighboring countries, the region, and the world that Afghanistan will not allow anyone to use its territory to threaten the security of other countries.  
He has called on other countries not to ""interfere"" in Afghanistan's internal affairs. 
Akhundada pledged that the Taliban will work to protect embassies, foreign organizations and investors.
He said that the Taliban is committed to freedom of speech within the framework of Islamic law and the national interests of the country, and that journalists should act on these two important points and adhere to the principles of journalism. 
On Saturday, a high-ranking delegation from the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan led by Chairman Abdullah Abdullah, and a Taliban delegation led by the deputy leader of the group Abdul Ghani Baradar, started peace negotiations with the hope of agreeing on key issues that will lead to a political settlement and an end to violence in the country.

Hibatullah’s message reads that the two sides are still wasting the opportunity for peace.

He asks journalists to adjust their activities based on these two points.

Akhundzada has pledged that the Taliban will work to protect embassies, foreign organizations and investors. He has said that no one will be allowed to pose threat to other countries from Afghanistan.

Diplomatic Missions Call for End to Taliban Offensive
","
The diplomatic missions to Afghanistan in a joint statement on Monday called on the Taliban to end the ""ongoing military offensive which thwarts effort to arrive at a negotiated solution to the conflict and harms and displaced civilians.” 
The statement was issued by the following missions: Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, the EU delegation, Finland, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States. 
“We condemn the continued targeted killings taking place throughout Afghanistan, the destruction of vital infrastructure, and threats, declarations, and other actions against the gains Afghans have made over the last twenty years, gains which we have strongly supported,” it said.  
The statement from the missions also said that the Taliban’s offensive is in direct contradiction to their claim to support a negotiated settlement to the conflict and to the Doha peace process. 
“It has resulted in loss of innocent Afghan lives, including through continued targeted killings, displacement of the civilian’s population, looting and burning of buildings, destruction of vital infrastructure, and damage to communication networks,” the statement said. 
“The indiscriminate detaining and killings of civilians and assaults of prisons demonstrates an extremely concerning disregard for the rule of law. In districts occupied by the Taliban, inhabitants and observers also credibly report attempts to repress the human rights of women and girls and to shut down private and public media organizations in an attempt to conceal their human rights abuses and diminish freedom of expression,” it states.
“On behalf of our respective missions, we vehemently condemn these and any other actions that violate the human rights of Afghan citizens. Afghans have made numerous gains over the past 20 years and want to continue building on their achievements in development, human rights, and free speech,” it noted. 
“We want to underscore that progress made over the past years can only be sustained if all parties work together,” it said. 
“We join the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan in calling on the Taliban and all parties to immediately end violence, agree to a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire, and engage fully in peace negotiations to end the suffering of the Afghan people and pave the way to an inclusive political settlement that benefits all Afghans and ensures that Afghanistan does not again serve as a safe haven for insurgents,” it added. 
The statement urged the Taliban to lay down their weapons during the Eid-ul-Adha ""for good"" and ""show the world their commitment to the peace process.""  
Also on Monday religious scholars from 34 provinces held a gathering and called for an immediate ceasefire in the country, saying they want a permanent end to the conflict.
""For the sake of God, stop this war. It has affected hundreds of people,"" said a religious scholar, who called on the warring parties to end hostilities.
The religious scholars issued a resolution and asked the warring parties to “solve the issue through talks.” 
“All sides must say yes to peace.”
The scholars urged countries in the region, including Pakistan and Iran, to help Afghanistan in its peace process.

Afghanistan Facing ‘Last Opportunities’ for Peace: Abdullah
","
In a message for Eid, Abdullah Abdullah, chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, said on Monday that Afghanistan is experiencing its “last opportunities” for peace and a political settlement. On Sunday, a two-day, high-level negotiation ended between Republic and Taliban delegates in Doha.
“The last opportunities remain for a political settlement and an enduring peace in Afghanistan,” Abdullah said. “The people of Afghanistan are expecting the peace negotiations to be expedited so the opportunity is not missed.”
Abdullah said no excuse remains for the continuation of violence as international forces are leaving.
He added that the continuation of violence, bloodshed and the destruction of infrastructure, public assets and the Afghan people’s achievements is a stance against the development and honor of Afghanistan.
Abdullah said the solution to the ongoing conflict is not through military means and that no group can reach its goal militarily.
“The solution to the 43 years of crisis in Afghanistan is through constructive and meaningful talks and a political settlement,” Abdullah reiterated. “Insisting on a military option shows that necessary lessons have not been learned from more than four decades of conflict (in Afghanistan).”
The negotiations in Doha, which were led by Abdullah on the Afghan Republic side and by Abdul Ghani Baradar for the Taliban, resulted in an agreement to expedite the peace efforts and continue high-level talks. However, this outcome fell short of meeting the people’s expectations for the meeting, especially amid increasing violence in the country.
The two sides issued a short joint statement in which they agreed to continue high-level talks on peace, but there was no mention of the de-escalation of violence or a ceasefire.
Moreover, Reuters reports that Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that the Taliban should “end the occupation of their brothers' soil,” and played down a warning from the militant group of consequences if Turkish troops remain in Afghanistan to run Kabul airport.
“(The Taliban) need to end the occupation of their brothers’ soil and show the world that peace is prevailing in Afghanistan right away,” Erdogan told reporters before leaving for a trip to northern Cyprus, as quoted by Reuters.
Many calls for an immediate ceasefire have been made in recent days amid an unprecedented increase in violence across the country. Diplomatic missions of Afghanistan’s major allies in Kabul, including the United States, in a joint statement on Monday called on the Taliban to end the “ongoing military offensive” and agree to an immediate ceasefire.
A similar call came from a group of religious scholars from around the country at a gathering in Kabul on Monday who said the people will stand against the Taliban if the group continues to insist on a military solution.

Defense Minister Mohammadi: Taliban Will Not Succeed By Force
","
Amid an unprecedented increase in the level of violence in the country, the acting minister of defense, Gen. Bismillah Mohammadi, warned that he will not allow the Taliban to impose their goals on the people by continuing their military campaign.
Mohammadi said that the support of the people, as evidenced by the joining up of public uprising forces with Afghan forces, has boosted the morale of the security forces and in some cases decreased the threat level.
“Today’s war and our legitimate defense are to ensure peace and stability and to end the suffering of our people,” Mohammadi said. “The Taliban will not succeed if they try to impose their goals on the people through force.”
The government said that the centers of Dara-e-Sof district in Samangan and Garmsir in Helmand have been retaken by ANDSF forces, while sources reported that Malistan district in Ghazni, Nijrab in Kapisa and Dehraood in Uruzgan have fallen to the Taliban in the last 24 hours.
The city of Taluqan in northeastern Afghanistan once again witnessed attacks by the Taliban on Sunday evening, according to officials. The attacks, officials said, were pushed back by security forces and public uprising forces.
In a recent clash in Takhar, the police chief of the province sustained injuries and is being treated in Kabul, according to officials.
“The situation in Takhar is not good. Clashes are underway. We call on both sides to agree to a ceasefire,” said Fahim Ibrahimi, a Takhar resident.
“I am on the frontlines. We will defend the city of Taluqan with the support of the Afghan forces,” said Malik Ahmad Tatar, a commander of the public uprising forces.
Besides Taluqan, the centers of Kandahar, Helmand, Ghazni, Faryab, Kunduz and Laghman provinces are also witnessing clashes between government forces and Taliban.
“The public uprising forces should be supported. There should be changes in appointments of leaders that were based on relations. Those who are effective should be deployed. This can prevent collapse,” said Khan Agha Rezaee, head of the internal security commission of the Parliament.
The Defense Ministry said that efforts are underway to clear areas from the Taliban that have recently fallen to the group.
“They should make public the reason why Nijrab collapsed: There were enough troops to protect the district,” said Hashmatullah Ishaq Zada, head of Kapisa's civil society association.
“The security forces, public uprising forces and the army succeeded in clearing the Taliban out of Dara-e-Sof district,” said Abdul Munir Rahimi, spokesman for the Samangan police.
The Defense Ministry says that at least 230 Taliban were killed in Afghan forces operations in various parts of the country in the last 24 hours. The Taliban has rejected the claim.

Afghan Delegation to Visit Pakistan Over Abduction Case: MoFA
","
The Afghan Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammad Haneef Atmar spoke with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi about an ongoing investigation into the abduction of the Afghan ambassador’s daughter, expressing deep concern over the remarks of the Pakistani Interior Minister.
Atmar said that ""unprofessional remarks and premature judgments could strongly affect bilateral relations and the credibility of the ongoing--and still incomplete--investigation.""
On Sunday, Pakistan’s interior minister appeared skeptical of the Afghan government’s version of events.
“She was not kidnapped, we have simply registered a case in which [she] says she was kidnapped,” Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said as quoted by Pakistan's Geo News.
Atmar reaffirmed Afghanistan’s commitment to cooperate with the government of Pakistan in pursuing the investigation to apprehend and prosecute the perpetrators of the crime and to ensure the security of Afghan political missions and diplomats in that country.
To this end, he said, an Afghan delegation will visit Pakistan, and subsequent actions will be taken regarding the return of the Afghan ambassador and diplomats, based on the delegation’s assessments and findings.
Expressing deep regrets and empathy, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Qureshi said Silsila Alikhil's case would be dealt with seriously as if she was one of “our own daughters,"" according to a statement by Pakistan's foreign ministry. 
As instructed by the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Qureshi added, the investigation would soon be concluded, and appropriate actions would be taken accordingly.
Qureshi assured Minister Atmar of Pakistan’s robust measures to ensure the security and safety of the Afghan missions and diplomats in Pakistan. 
On Sunday President Ashraf Ghani recalled the Afghan ambassador and senior diplomats from Islamabad, citing the incident.
Silsila Alikhil was abducted in Islamabad on Friday and according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, she was tortured before being released.

500 Civilians Maimed, Severely Injured in Kunduz in Past Month
","
Figures by aid agencies indicate that at least 500 civilians have been maimed or in some way severely injured in the last month of fighting in the northeastern province of Kunduz. Over 130 of them are children, the report said.
The report issued by local aid agencies covers incidents between June 11 and July 17. It shows that most of the children affected in this period have been maimed or have received serious damage to a body part, particularly limbs.
“Most of them are either children or teenagers whose limbs have been amputated or they have sustained damage to the face,” said Esmatullah Hotak, head of an aid organization that operates under the UN in Kunduz.
“We helped 315 families… we are monitoring others,” said Najibullah Omarkhil, the acting governor of Kunduz.
Meanwhile, those affected by the conflict in Kunduz in recent years gathered in the provincial capital and called for an immediate end to the violence.
“We were displaced three times in the past month. Four members of our family have been wounded,” said Sharifa, a displaced person in Kunduz.
“I was wounded in clashes one-and-a-half months ago. We want peace. We are tired of war,” said Naqibullah, a displaced person in Kunduz.
“My limb has been cut off. We are tired of war. We want peace. We want justice,” said Shah Mohammad, a resident of Imam Sahib district in Kunduz.
Figures by the government show that at least 12,000 families have been displaced in recent clashes in Kunduz.

Afghan Clerics Call for Immediate Ceasefire
","
A large group of religious scholars from across Afghanistan held a gathering on Monday and made strong demands that the Afghan government and the Taliban agree to a ceasefire, make efforts for peace and stop the violence that “brings destruction and killings” to the people and the country.
The scholars said that religious clerics and politicians from Pakistan are involved in Afghanistan’s war.
Citing the unprecedented increase in violence, widespread displacement of civilians, and the damage to infrastructure in some provinces, the scholars said there is an urgent need to end the bloodshed, calling the ongoing war ""forbidden"" by Islam and decrying the conflict as it is killing Afghans.
“Let’s be part of an effort to end the suffering of the people,” said Jamaluddin Fayiq, a religious scholar.
“The religious scholars ask the warring parties to support peace and end ongoing problems through negotiations,” said Jalaluddin Hanafi, a religious scholar.
The clerics said Afghans will stand against the Taliban if the group refuses to join peace. They also called on the government to avoid creating obstacles in the way of peace.
“Neither the republic nor the emirate is holy, but the only way out for us is through the teachings of the Quran,” said Mohammad Sarwar Omari, the head of the secretariat of the religious scholars' council.
Other scholars emphasized that neither the republic nor an emirate can end people’s problems.
“Pakistani religious scholars and its government are interfering in our country,” said Hisamuddin Hisam, head of the religious scholars' council.
They blamed the government for failing to prevent targeted attacks against religious scholars.
“The arrest of religious scholars should stop, the targeted killing of religious scholars should stop, and our demand from the Taliban is to agree to a ceasefire,” said Abdul Qadir Qanit, head of the Kabul religious scholars' council.
“We and you journalists are martyred together. The reason might be that you are raising the people’s voice and freedom of speech and religious scholars, too, are raising the people’s voice,” said Mohammad Monir, a religious scholar from Baghlan.
The call by the religious scholars comes as the country observed a short-term ceasefire in April and it was expected to have another ceasefire this Eid, which is celebrated this week. As of Monday evening, no announcements have been made.  
This comes as Abdullah Abdullah, head of the reconciliation council, in a message of peace said no excuse remains for the continuation of violence as international forces are leaving.
Abdullah said the continuation of violence, bloodshed and the destruction of infrastructure, public assets and the Afghan people’s achievements is a stance against the development and honor of Afghanistan.
He added that ""the last opportunities remain"" for a political settlement and an enduring peace and that the people of Afghanistan are expecting the peace negotiations to be expedited so the opportunity is not missed.

President Ghani Blasts Taliban for Having ‘No Will’ for Peace
","
President Ashraf Ghani in a speech on Eid said recent deeds by the Taliban showed the group has “no will” for peace and going forward, decisions by the government will be made based on that.
Ghani said the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan’s decision to send a high-ranking delegation to Doha for negotiations was an ultimatum.
“Taliban made clear many things. Mr. Abdullah told me some minutes ago that there is no will for peace in Taliban. We sent the delegation to do the ultimatum and to show that we have the will for peace and we are ready for sacrifice for it, but they (Taliban) have no will for peace and we should make decisions based on this,” Ghani said.
Ghani said this Eid has been named after Afghan forces to honor their sacrifices and courage, especially in the last three months.
“Afghanistan’s security and defense forces have made many sacrifices in the last 20 years, especially in the last three months, to defend this soil and honor of this homeland, sincerely,” Ghani said.
He added that he has spent the last week working on an “urgent and practical plan” to overcome the current situation. President Ghani says Afghans should prove in action that they are united.
“This plan has been prepared. It has two parts in terms of security,” he said. He added that one part of the plan is setting priorities for security and defense forces.
He said a firm stance by the people for the next three to six months will change the situation.
Ghani reiterated that there is a need for national support and national defense and said the future of Afghanistan will be made in Afghanistan and by Afghans.
He said today’s Afghanistan is not the one it was 20 years ago and every city has signs of development.
“There is no place for forming militias and arbitrariness in this country,” he said.
He said the Taliban “destroyed 260 public buildings” and that if they are Afghans they should avoid eliminating public establishments and people’s houses.
Ghani said the government released 5,000 Taliban prisoners but the group so far has not been ready for meaningful talks.

Erdogan Seeks US Support for Kabul Airport Mission
","
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday asked the United States to provide financial, logistical and diplomatic support so that Turkey can agree to run and guard the International Hamid Karzai Airport in Kabul after other foreign troops leave the country.
Recently, Ankara offered to deploy troops to Kabul airport after NATO fully withdraws, but the decision has faced opposition by the Taliban.
“First of all, the United States will take sides with us in terms of diplomacy and diplomatic relations. Secondly, in terms of logistics, they will use every means available for us,” Erdogan said at a ceremony in Northern Cyprus. “Secondly, in terms of logistics, they will use every means available for us. They will hand over every logistical ability they have to Turkey. And finally, there will be serious financial and administerial difficulties during this process. They will give the necessary support to Turkey in this respect as well. If these conditions could be met, we are thinking of taking over the management of Kabul airport.”
Erdogan said Ankara looks positively at the proposal to take over the airport mission but listed conditions including diplomatic backing of Turkey and the US handover of facilities and logistics in Afghanistan.
Quoted by Reuters, Erdogan acknowledged that the Taliban had reservations but said Turkey would nonetheless carry out the mission as long as the United States, a NATO partner, meets three specific Turkish requirements.
“In the meantime, the Taliban has some qualms. We will hold talks with the Taliban over this period like they held some talks with United States. They should be able to hold these talks with Turkey more comfortably,” he said.

Army Base in US to House Afghan Visa Seekers
","
The Biden administration said Monday it would evacuate about 2,500 Afghans who worked for the US government and their families to a military base in Virginia pending approval of their visas.
The administration informed Congress that the Afghans will be housed at Fort Lee, a sprawling Army base south of Richmond starting next week.
The administration announced earlier this month that it would soon begin relocating Afghan visa seekers under an initiative known as ""Operation Allies Refuge.""
The group to be housed at Fort Lee is just a small portion of the number of Afghans seeking refuge in the United States. Roughly 20,000 have expressed interest in applying for so-called ""Special Immigrant Visas"" to move to the US, but only about half of them are far enough along in the vetting process to be considered for relocation.
“At the president's direction, the Department of State is working to relocate interested, eligible Afghan nationals and their families who have been approved through the Special Immigrant Visa or SIV program,” Price said. “As you heard from the president, approximately 2500 Afghans and family members are currently eligible to finish special immigrant processing in the United States and will certainly provide more details as they become available.”
The announcement comes amid growing concerns for the safety of Afghans who served as translators and in other support roles for American troops and diplomats as the administration rapidly moves to complete the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan.
“We will continue to partner with the Afghan people, to partner with the Afghan government and support that diplomatic process that did receive a boost over the weekend from the joint declaration that was issued by the Afghan parties. Again, declarations are positive. What we are going to be looking for is the follow through and we expect to see that follow through in the coming days and weeks,” Ned Price, State Department spokesman.
It also comes one day after the leader of the Taliban said that his movement is committed to a political settlement to end decades of war in Afghanistan
However, insurgents have been battling in dozens of districts across the country to gain territory.
The statement by Maulawi Hibatullah Akhunzada came as Taliban leaders were meeting with a high-level Afghan government delegation in the Gulf state of Qatar to jump-start stalled peace talks.
The talks resumed Saturday, ahead of the four-day Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, which in many parts of the world is expected to start Tuesday.
Washington’s peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who is in Qatar, previously expressed hopes for a reduction in violence and possibly a ceasefire over Eid al-Adha.

Thousands of families who have been displaced because of the conflict and other reasons are cutoff from larger family support networks and are struggling to find shelter and take care of other basic needs.
In one instance, at least five families are living in one home in Kabul. The families have all been displaced from Kunduz due to the ongoing conflict in the northern province.
The families said they are in dire need of humanitarian assistance.

“We have not seen a happy day. We have always witnessed clashes,” Ziba said.

“We were caught between two sides. The Taliban was firing from one side and government forces from another side,” said Mohammad Hasan.
Displaced children will not celebrate a normal, festive Eid this year.
“What will our future be if peace does not come? It is a question for everyone. What will our future be? You will achieve something if you get educated. What will you do if you do not get educated?” said Sona, a displaced person.

Atta Mohammad Noor, an Afghan politician who attended the two-day negotiations with the Taliban delegation in Doha, said the group sought the release of more prisoners and the removal of its leaders' names from the UN blacklist as a trust-building measure.
But Noor said this will not happen and the government will not repeat its previous act--of releasing 5,000 inmates--which did not help in reducing violence or furthering the peace process in the country. 
He added that three commissions were formed during the two days of talks in Doha – the commission for building trust, commission on review of the Constitution and the commission for partnership in power – but none led to any results. 
Noor said that trust can be built through other ways. 
“Trust can be built through understanding, partnership in power, political partnership, end of war, reduction in violence, and ceasefire. We could have started from any other route, but regretfully, this did not happen,” Noor said. 
He welcomed the agreement in Doha for the continuation of negotiations and the protection of civilians and their property but said that there are other ways that trust can be built between both sides. 
“We hope that one day the other side will realize that war is not the solution in Afghanistan and peace is in the interest of all sides,” he said. 
Meanwhile, President Ghani on a trip to Herat province on Monday accused the Taliban of having secret deals with Pakistan about the Durand Line, water, mines and security forces in Afghanistan, and said the group has destroyed over 140 mosques.

No reports have been made on Tuesday, the first day of Eid, about attacks by the Taliban or clashes in contested districts between the government forces and the militant group, despite there being no announced agreement on a ceasefire. The cessation of fighting allowed Afghans to celebrate the beginning of the holiday with calm.
The Afghan government and Taliban were expected to announce at least a three-day ceasefire during this Eid, but it did not happen despite a high-level meeting in Doha between representatives of both sides.
“We are ready to thwart any plan by the enemy,” said Dadan Lawang, Commander of the Afghan Army’s 203 Thunder Corps.
TOLOnews reporter Hasiba Atakpal who visited a security forces post on the outskirts of Gardez city in Paktia said there were some soldiers who did not visit their families for five months, and many have remained at their posts rather than going to their homes to celebrate Eid.
One of those soldiers on duty is Zikrullah, an army officer who says he hasn’t visited his family for the last five months and that during 10 years of service, he has always celebrated Eid festivals with his comrades.
“Every day in which we are in our strongholds and the people are happy is a happy day and Eid for us,” Zikrullah said.
The security forces pledged that they will soon retake control of areas that have fallen to the Taliban in the province.
“We are ready to defend the country” said Shafiqullah, a soldier.
“I assure you that the fallen districts will be retaken by us,” said Mohammad Ghani, a solider.
Acting Defense Minister Gen. Bismullah Mohammadi visited Paktia province on Tuesday to meet with his soldiers on the frontlines.
He said that Afghan forces are fighting for peace, not for the continuation of war.
“We should have reached an agreement in the last 25 years, but you witnessed that the Taliban dominated a specific part of Afghanistan but could not get a result. Conflicts continued, and they did some deeds in Kabul and other areas, but none were acceptable to the people of Afghanistan,” Mohammadi said.
Tribal elders and members of the provincial council in Paktia said they support the government forces but criticized the handover of some districts to the Taliban by some security force members.
“Anyone who is here, especially if they have a military uniform--their character will be judged if they leave a district,” said Abdul Malik Mujahid Zazai, head of Paktia provincial council.
“Our demand is that Paktia should be given air support in its operations,” said Amanullah Zadran, a tribal elder.

Detainee Transferred Out of Guantanamo Bay
","
President Joe Biden's administration said on Monday that it had transferred its first detainee from the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay, a Moroccan man imprisoned since 2002, lowering the population at the facility to 39, Reuters reported. 
Abdul Latif Nasir, 56, was repatriated to Morocco.  
“I was born again on July 19. My birthday is no longer March 4. I was born yesterday on July 19,"" Abdul Latif Nasir said in a statement shared with ABC News. “I have no words to describe my overwhelming sense of happiness and joy. It is like a miracle after 20 years to be home and celebrate Eid together with my family.” 
On Tuesday, the legal charity Reprieve, which campaigned for his release and provided legal support, confirmed to ABC News that Nasser was reunited with his family in Morocco. 
Nasir, whose case was profiled by ABC News in 2019, was first cleared for release from Guantanamo more than five years ago. He had been detained there for 19 years after he was captured in Afghanistan, alleged by the US government to be an active member of the Taliban and then to have trained with al-Qaeda. 
Guantanamo set up to house foreign suspects following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, the prison came to symbolize the excesses of the US “war on terror” because of harsh interrogation methods critics said amounted to torture, Reuters said in the report. 
While former President Donald Trump kept the prison open during his four years in the White House, Biden has vowed to close it, a promise White House press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated on Monday.  
Nasir had been cleared for release in 2016 during the Obama administration before Trump took office. Most of the prisoners left at Guantanamo Bay have been held for nearly two decades without being charged or tried.  
""The (Biden) administration is dedicated to following a deliberate and thorough process focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population of the Guantanamo facility while also safeguarding the security of the United States and its allies,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.  
Morocco's general prosecutor said in a statement that Nasir would be investigated for suspected involvement in terrorist acts, and a police source said he had been taken into custody in Casablanca.  
More than a dozen Moroccans have been held at Guantanamo Bay and those repatriated have faced investigation and trial. One, Ibrahim Benchekroun, was jailed for six years after being repatriated in 2005 and died in 2014 in Syria where he had traveled to join a militant group.  
A senior US administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that of the remaining detainees at the prison, 10 are already eligible for transfer.  
Advocacy groups welcomed the move but said more needed to be done.  
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last month that the administration was actively looking into recreating the position of a State Department envoy for the closure of the prison at the Guantanamo Bay naval base.

Taliban Has 'Deep Ties' With Al-Qaeda, Other Groups: Ghani
","
President Ashraf Ghani visited the Special Operations Command Center in Kabul on Wednesday and said that the Taliban has “deep ties"" with Al-Qaeda, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed and the group want Afghanistan “to become a haven for insurgents.”
“The government will never allow this to happen,” President Ghani said while visiting the center to give a greeting for Eid, the Presidential Palace said in a statement. Ghani pledged to provide ""any kind of support,"" for Afghan special operations forces.
He promised to address the needs of families of the security force members who have lost their lives while serving their country.
""Our goal is to protect Afghanistan, freedom, equality and the achievements of the last 20 years, but the intention of the enemy is dark,"" Ghani said, ""and you prove to the enemy they will take their dreams to the grave.""
The president said that ""the water"" and the ""strategic position"" is Afghanistan's, and because of this ""enemies are plotting and want to take revenge on us by war.”


 



He also said: “We have the will to establish a just and lasting peace” in the country, “but the enemies must know that we will never surrender. You have the capability to show to the world and any other force and prove your capacity.”
“Afghanistan is the common home for all Afghans, and it is our national duty to protect it until the last moment of our lives,” he added.


 



On Tuesday, President Ghani in a speech for Eid said recent deeds by the Taliban showed the group has “no will” for peace and, going forward, decisions by the government will be made based on that.
Ghani said the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan’s decision to send a high-ranking delegation to Doha for negotiations was to determine their will for peace.
“The Taliban made clear many things. Mr. Abdullah told me some minutes ago that there is no will for peace among the Taliban. We sent the delegation ... to show that we have the will for peace and we are ready for sacrifice for it, but they (Taliban) have no will for peace and we should make decisions based on this,” Ghani said.
Ghani said this Eid has been dedicated to Afghan forces to honor their sacrifices and courage, especially in the last three months.
“Afghanistan’s security and defense forces have made many sacrifices in the last 20 years, especially in the last three months, to defend this soil and honor this homeland,” Ghani said.
He added that he has spent the last week working on an “urgent and practical plan” to overcome the current situation. President Ghani said Afghans should prove in their actions that they are united.
“This plan has been prepared. It has two parts in terms of security,” he said. He added that one part of the plan is setting priorities for security and defense forces.
He said a firm stance by the people for the next three to six months will change the situation.
Ghani reiterated that there is a need for national support and national defense and said the future of Afghanistan will be made in Afghanistan and by Afghans.
He said today’s Afghanistan is not the one it was 20 years ago and every city has signs of development.
“There is no place for forming militias and arbitrariness in this country,” he said.
He said the Taliban “destroyed 260 public buildings” and that if they are Afghans they should avoid eliminating public establishments and people’s houses.
Ghani said the government released 5,000 Taliban prisoners but the group so far has not been ready for meaningful talks.

Afghanistan Relatively Calm on Second Day of Eid
","
Afghanistan remained relatively calm on the second day of Eid, including in those provinces which saw some of the fiercest battles over the past few weeks.
Residents in embattled areas called on the warring parties to make compromises and avoid further war.
However, the Afghan Ministry of Defense (MoD) said that widespread attacks were reported in at least ten provinces, adding that the Afghan security forces managed to repel these attacks. But the Taliban has rejected the allegations, saying their fighters have been in a defensive stance during the Eid days.
“It is now three days that we hear firing in Taluqan,” said Rahman, a resident of Takhar.
“People want a ceasefire,” said Lotfullah, a resident in Takhar.
No security incidents were reported in provincial capitals Ghazni city, Kandahar city or Maimana during the Eid days, despite recent battles in these areas.
“The situation is peaceful in Ghazni now, there is no fighting, but the people are fearful,"" said Wahid, a resident in Ghazni.
“Our people want peace,” said Gul Mohammad, a resident in Faryab.
“They had their activities in 19 provinces and in 35 districts, the security and defense forces repelled their attacks, casualties were also inflicted on the enemy,” said Rohullah Ahmadzai, a defense ministry spokesman.
“We will soon launch our offensive operations to recapture the areas that have been lost,” said Khanullah Shuja, the commander of 209 Shaheen Army Corps.
“They (Taliban) should take advantage of the opportunity and engage in peace talks,” said Dur Mohammad, an Afghan police officer.
“We are defending--for the sake of Afghanistan and the people,” said Gulbuddin, an Afghan police officer.
This comes a day after President Ashraf Ghani during his Eid message said that the government was working on a new security plan to improve the country’s security situation in the next three to six months.

Russian Envoy: Taliban Ready for Political Settlement

Russian envoy Zamir Kabulov said that the Talban’s violence has increased but the group is ready to seek a political settlement for the conflict.
He said that there is a possibility that the Taliban in the future will take over the cities, but the group will not have the capacity to maintain their control.
“I think they are fed up with war, they now realize that they have to look for a political solution,” said Kabulov.
Meanwhile, former Afghan president Hamid Karzai said that reaching a peaceful agreement in Afghanistan requires sincere and honest cooperation from the US and other major powers of the world.
“Neither the Taliban should try to take by force nor should the Afghan government try to continue the conflict in the name of defeating the Taliban,” said Karzai.
“Taliban at the moment fears to seize control in the major centers,” said Kabulov.
“Until now there are no indications that they are willing to seek a political settlement or to stop violence and destruction,” said MP Sadiq Qaderi.
“The people expect that the enemy stops the violence and realizes the opportunity for peace,” said Latif Mahmoud, deputy spokesman to the president.

Taliban Demanding Funds, Recruiting in Balkh: Officials
","
The Taliban are forcing the local people who live in areas under the group's control in Balkh province to pay them part of their income, Afghan local authorities in the northern province said on Wednesday. “The Taliban are also trying to recruit from among the local people,” said the officials.
“There are only about 20 Taliban fighters inside the district building compound and the police headquarters; the rest of them have taken up positions inside the villages to collect Zakat (charity),” said Mohammad Yousuf, the acting district governor of Kaldar district.
The officials said that the number of Taliban fighters in the district numbers only about 200 fighters, but they are looking to recruit more fighters from among the people.
Earlier this month the Taliban managed to take over the center of Kaldar district. Later on the Afghan security forces were deployed five kilometers away from the district to prevent a possible move by the Taliban into Hairatan border crossing, a key financial dry port in the north.
“They have imposed taxes on the shops and bazaars and on the local people--which is beyond their capacity to pay. They also harassed the people who don’t have the capacity to pay a large amount of money,” said Mohammad Hashem Mansoori, a district governor for Shortepa district in Balkh province.
Business activity has also been affected following the increased violence by the Taliban, especially in those regions where there are dry ports, such as at Hairatan.
“The people have serious concerns, the business owners are very fearful because of the businesses,” said Sifatullah, a resident in Hairatan.
Security authories however have assured the people that the Afghan security forces are fully prepared to defend the people’s lives and property.
“The morale of our forces is very high, they are fully prepared and have the strength to defend the city. Soon we will launch our offensive operations,” said Khanullah Shuja, the commander of 209 Shaheen Army Corps.
Balkh has 14 districts, nine of which are under Taliban control.

Austin Says Afghanistan Drawdown Will Complete by End of August
","
US Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin on Wednesday said that the withdrawal of American troops will finish by end of August, a date that was announced President Joe Biden. 
He said the US military has tasks to accomplish which include protecting US diplomatic presence in Afghanistan, providing funding to Afghan forces, advising Afghan ministries and preventing the re-emergence of a transnational terrorist threat from the country.
""We are still on track to finish up [the retrograde] by the end of August,"" Austin said at a joint press conference with General Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff.
""These are friends of the United States who have done exemplary and courageous work, and we take our obligations to them and their families very seriously,” he said.
Meanwhile, Gen. Mark Milley said that all the military operating bases outside of Kabul have been fully transferred to the Afghan Ministry of Defense and the Afghan security forces.
“A small contingent of predominantly military personnel, but some civilians and contractors, along with Department of State, remain in Afghanistan to provide security and bolster our diplomatic presence in Kabul. The forces here are key to achieving the five ongoing tasks that the secretary laid out in his comments,” he said.
A major component of sustaining a robust diplomatic presence in Kabul is to maintain a functioning and secure airport in Kabul, he said.
“So, we continue to dedicate our security resources to that, to secure the embassy, to secure the international zone and secure HKIA, the international airport in Kabul for our diplomats, our personnel and our continued support to the government of Afghanistan,” Milley added.
He said Afghan Security Forces have the capacity to sufficiently fight and defend their country, and we will continue to support the Afghan Security Forces where necessary in accordance with the guidance from the president and the secretary of defense.
“The future of Afghanistan is squarely in the hands of the Afghan people, and there are a range of possible outcome in Afghanistan. And I want to emphasis repeatedly, and I've said this before, a negative outcome, a Taliban automatic military takeover, is not a forgone conclusion. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and make adjustments as necessary,” he stated.
Milley said the US will maintain the capability of self-defense. 
""We possess the military means and have several options at our disposal to fully protect our force in Afghanistan and throughout the region,” he added.
He said the US maintains an agile over-the-horizon counterterrorism capability that is set up and effective now to detect and address any terrorism threat to the United States.
On Taliban attacks, he said: “I would tell you that as of today, more or less -- I guess it's about 212, 213, it's in that range -- the 200s -- of the district centers are in Taliban control. It's about half of the 419 that are out there.”
He added: “You've got 34 provincial capitals in Afghanistan. None of them have been seized, as of today, by the Taliban, although the Taliban is putting pressure on the outskirts of probably about half of them -- 17 of them, in fact -- and what they're trying to do is isolate the major population centers. They're trying to do the same thing to Kabul,"" he said.

US Calls on Taliban, Govt to End Violence 'Immediately'
","
The US embassy on Thursday has called on the Taliban and all parties “to immediately end the violence and agree to a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire.” 
“We call on the Taliban and all parties to immediately end the violence, agree to a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire, and engage fully in peace negotiations to end the suffering of the Afghan people,” the embassy said. 
“Pave the way to an inclusive political settlement that benefits all Afghans and ensures that Afghanistan does not again serve as a safe haven for terrorists,” it said. 
This comes as the diplomatic missions to Afghanistan in a joint statement on Monday also called on the Taliban to end the ""ongoing military offensive which thwarts efforts to arrive at a negotiated solution to the conflict and harms and displaces civilians.”  
The statement was issued by the following missions: Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, the EU delegation, Finland, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States.  
“We condemn the continued targeted killings taking place throughout Afghanistan, the destruction of vital infrastructure, and threats, declarations, and other actions against the gains Afghans have made over the last twenty years, gains which we have strongly supported,” it said.   
The statement from the missions also said that the Taliban’s offensive is in direct contradiction to the group's claim to support a negotiated settlement to the conflict and to the Doha peace process.  
“It has resulted in loss of innocent Afghan lives, including through continued targeted killings, displacement of the civilian population, looting and burning of buildings, destruction of vital infrastructure, and damage to communication networks,” the statement said.

In response to remarks by Kabulov, the Afghan foreign ministry in a statement on Thursday said if Mr. Kabulov has credible information, he should share it with the Afghan government.
The ministry said that the Taliban does not believe in resolving the Afghan crisis politically. 
""If Mr. Kabulov has access to credible information and findings showing that the Taliban's real intention is to resolve the conflict peacefully, share it with us so we can make further progress in the peace process,” it added.

36,000 Families Displaced in Last 4 Months: MoRR
","
The Ministry of Repatriation and Refugees said on Thursday that about 36,000 families have been internally displaced in the last four months as a result of fighting between security forces and insurgent groups. 
The ministry is concerned that the number of internally displaced people will increase significantly if the war continues.
Internally displaced people in Kunduz province say they live in difficult conditions in Kabul, where many families are flocking and facing a shortage of shelter and other basic needs.
Gol Mohammad is one of the displaced people who fled Kunduz province and traveled to Kabul with his family several weeks ago.
He says the current wars have forced large numbers of families in the province to flee their homes.
Gul Mohammad, a displaced person from Kunduz province, said: “The reason for our migration from one place to another is the war, nothing else. Otherwise, no one leaves his or her home during EID days.”
The war has not only displaced Kunduz residents, but it has also forced other residents from other provinces to leave their homes due to the escalation of the conflict between government forces and the Taliban to save their lives.
“Our homes, our life--everything--we left there and we came and migrated to this place. We do not know whether our homes are looted or burned,"" said Hameed, a displaced person from Kunduz.
“I came here only with one set of clothes, I swear to God that I borrowed money for taxi costs to come here, such misery is continuing,” said Hasan, another displaced person from Kunduz.
The Ministry of Refugees and Repatriations said thousands of families have been forced to flee their homes as a result of recent escalated fighting across the country.
Sayed Abdul Basit Ansari, advisor to the Ministry of Repatriation and Refugees, said: “Since Hamal (March), about 36 thousand and 500 families have been displaced from their homes due to war and insecurity in several provinces.”
Families who have been forced to flee their homes in Kandahar, Laghman, and Kunduz provinces as a result of the war say the government and aid agencies have no plans to help the internally displaced people and meet their needs. However, the Ministry of Repatriation and Refugees has pledged that some programs are being implemented to help internally displaced people.

“They have laid a siege around Ghazi Abad, there are no supply routes to deliver food,” said Iqbal Saeed, the governor of Kunar.

“This unveils the real face of the cruel enemy,” added Stanekzai.
Meanwhile, a member of Kandahar's provincial council has said that two of his sons were taken from their home a day before Eid began and both were killed by the unidentified gunmen.
The Taliban has denied any involvement in the killing of civilians.
Fida Mohammad Afghan, a member of Kandahar's provincial council, said that unidentified gunmen took his two sons out of the house a day before Eid and then killed them. Afghan is a resident of Spin Boldak.
Afghan said that his sons were not associated with any military group.
“They say that they were not associated with the movement (Taliban), but whoever they are, they must be apprehended and they must be brought to justice,” said Fida Mohammad Afghan, a member of the Kandahar provincial council.
“Some people say they have taken away 380 people, and those who were killed are still lying there,” said Fida Mohammad Afghan.
According to the Afghan security agencies, the dead bodies of several civilians are still lying on the ground in Spin Boldak.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid rejected the allegations.
“They (Taliban) conduct these acts on the orders of their masters, they want to give the color of an ethnic war to their proxy war,” said Stanekzai.

Taliban Seeks Agreement on New Govt Before Any Ceasefire: AP
","
A Taliban spokesman has said they don’t want to monopolize power but insisted that there won’t be peace in Afghanistan until there is a new negotiated government in Kabul and President Ashraf Ghani is removed.
In an interview with The Associated Press, Suhail Shaheen, Taliban spokesman and a member of the group’s negotiating team, said the Taliban will lay down their weapons when a negotiated government acceptable to all sides in the conflict is installed in Kabul and Ghani’s government is gone.
“I want to make it clear that we do not believe in the monopoly of power because any governments who (sought) to monopolize power in Afghanistan in the past, were not successful governments,” said Shaheen in the interview.
“So we do not want to repeat that same formula.”
He called the talks a good beginning but said the government’s repeated demands for a ceasefire while Ghani stayed in power were tantamount to demanding a Taliban surrender.
“They don’t want reconciliation, but they want surrendering,” he said.  
Before any ceasefire, there must be an agreement on a new government “acceptable to us and to other Afghans,” he said in the AP interview. Then “there will be no war.”
Shaheen said under this new government, women will be allowed to work, go to school, and participate in politics, but will have to wear the hijab, or headscarf.
He said women won’t be required to have a male relative with them to leave their home, and that Taliban commanders in newly occupied districts have orders that universities, schools and markets operate as before, including with the participation of women and girls.  
Shaheen said some Taliban commanders had ignored the leadership's orders against repressive and drastic behavior and that several have been put before a Taliban military tribunal and punished, though he did provide specifics.
He contended the video was fake, a splicing of separate footage.
He said there are no plans to make a military push on Kabul and that the Taliban have so far “restrained” themselves from taking provincial capitals.
But he warned they could, given the weapons and equipment they have acquired in newly captured districts.
He contended that the majority of the Taliban's battlefield successes came through negotiations, not fighting.
“Those districts which have fallen to us and the military forces who have joined us ... were through mediation of the people, through talks,” he said. “They (did not fall) through fighting ... it would have been very hard for us to take 194 districts in just eight weeks.”
This comes as US Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin on Wednesday said that the withdrawal of American troops will finish by end of August.
Meanwhile, Gen. Mark Milley said that all the military operating bases outside of Kabul have been fully transferred to the Afghan Ministry of Defense and the Afghan security forces.

US House Approves Plan to Add 8,000 Visas for At-Risk Afghans
","
The United States House of Representatives on Thursday approved a plan to allow an extra 8,000 special immigration visas for Afghans who helped the US and are at risk of retaliation as American troops are leaving the country.
According to a Reuters report, the bipartisan bill, which passed with a vote of 407 to 16, will now be considered by the Senate. 
The plan also aims to speed up the processing of the visas, Reuters reported.
Representative Jason Crow, a Democrat who led the group that sponsored the bill, said the additional visas would cover all potentially eligible applicants in the pipeline. 
US State Department spokesman Ned Price said that since 2008, the department has issued more than 73,000 special immigrant visas to Afghan principal applicants and their eligible family members. 
“In the last fiscal year, Fiscal Year 2020, we issued nearly 8,000 special immigrant visas to principal applicants and their derivative spouses and children. So, this is a program and a form of support to the brave Afghans who have helped the U.S. Government in myriad ways over the years. That has been ongoing for over a decade now,” he said.
Reuters reports that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged last month that there were about 18,000 possible applicants.
“For too long, there has not been a sense of urgency that is necessary to ensure safety for the people who put their lives on the line to help Americans in these difficult circumstances,” said Representative Earl Blumenauer, a Democrat, as quoted by Reuters.
This comes as Afghans who helped or worked with the US forces in the last 20 years held different rallies in Kabul and asked for protection as American troops are leaving.

This comes as Taliban is capturing more and more territory, which the Pentagon estimates now extends to over half of Afghanistan’s district centers.
Quoted by Reuters, Imomali Ibrohimzoda, deputy head of Tajikistan’s emergencies committee, on Friday said his country is already building two large warehouses to store supplies for refugees in the Khatlon and Gorno-Badakhshan provinces adjacent to the border.
According to Reuters report, a few hundred Afghan civilians fled to Tajikistan this month, but the Dushanbe government says they have already returned to Afghanistan.
This comes as Russia has sent its forces and equipment to border areas between Afghanistan and Tajikistan amidst an increase in insecurity in northern Afghanistan.

Critics See 'No Change' on Battlefields Despite Recent Reshuffles
","
Two lawmakers and military experts on Friday raised their deep apprehensions over the Taliban’s continued advances in various regions of the country, saying there has been no change on the ground despite the recent reshuffles in the country’s security entities.
A month ago, President Ashraf Ghani announced the appointment of Gen. Bismillah Mohammadi as acting minister of defense, Gen. Abdul Sattar Mirzakwal as acting minister of interior and Gen. Mohammad Wali Ahmadzai as Chief of Army Staff.  
MPs argued that 70 districts, 6 customs and border towns were fallen to the Taliban since the appointment of new security chiefs over the last month.
“It would be quite difficult for them (new security officials) to bring a sudden change. These discussions should have started at least one year or one and half years ago,” said Rahmatullah Nabil, the former head of the NDS.
“There has been no positive change on the ground with the arrival of these officials due to the large intensity of the war,” said MP Mir Haidar Afzali.
“The Presidential Palace major mistake is in terms of policy making and now only the people pay the price,” said MP Mohammad Azim Kibrzani.,
Military experts said there is a need for unity and better coordination within the nation’s security agencies and in the leadership level to fix the fragile security situation.
But officials from the Ministry of Interior Affairs and the Ministry of Defense said security forces managed to retake 20 districts from the Taliban since the appointment of the acting defense and interior minister and that there were better mobilization of forces in the fight against the insurgents.
“They suddenly started fighting in 400 points across the country. In some cases, there were negligence or issues weren’t addressed and then there were some tactical retreats,” said Abdul Sattar Mirzakwal, acting minister of interior.
“We tried to remobilize and support. We have identified the priorities, we will use all available resources to defend the people, the cities and the districts where we are deployed now,” said Mohammadi.

ANDSF Retakes Herat’s Karokh District Amid Fresh Spate of Battles
","
The Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) on Friday retook the control of Karokh district in Herat but one district fell to the Taliban in the last 24 hours.
This follows a relative calm across the country during the first and second days of Eid.
“A joint attack was carried out against the Taliban positions. These brave men managed to swiftly recapture this district from the Taliban,” said Jailani Farhad, a spokesman to Herat governor.
Sources said Taliban captured Ghazi Abad district in Kunar province.
The Defense Ministry said that government forces inflicted heavy casualties to the Taliban in at least 10 provinces across the country in the past 24 hours and killed over 150 Taliban fighters. Taliban has rejected the claims.
While Taliban is still trying to capture more swaths of land in the country, the Afghan security institutions have said that the ANDSF as part of the new security plan is trying to retake the country’s financial ports and other strategic locations from the militant group. The Afghan government recently said it will soon unveil a three to six months security plan based on which the ANDSF will be able to change the current situation.
Kunar is one of the provinces in the eastern parts of the county that saw some of the fiercest battles over the past few weeks. But Afghan officials have said that several villages have been cleared of the Taliban in the area.
“The government forces conquered areas in Chilamazar, Qaria-e-Mullah Ishaq and areas around Tapa-e-Taimoor, the enemies left these areas,” Kunduz police chief Zubair Safai said.
Nevertheless, President Ashraf Ghani has said that based on the new plan, the current security situation will change once the new security strategy is practically put in place.
Based on the new plan, the ANDSF will beef up security measures for major cities, airports, highways, strategic locations and ports.
“You resist for three months. In six months time, you will reach your desirable peace. Today the Taliban haae no will for peace,” Ghani said on Thursday.
“You can see that the public mindset is totally against the Taliban. No city in Afghanistan will collapse. All the strategic distircts and important border towns will be retaken,” the deputy minister of interior for policy and strategy, Naqibullah Fayeq, said.
There are also reports that at least 10 civilians have been killed in various provinces in the past 24 hours as a result of rewned violence.
Since the official announcement of the US forces' withdrawal, 215 districts, including several economically-important port areas, are under Taliban influence.

Meanwhile, Rahmatullah Nabil, the former head of Afghanistan’s intelligence agency has said that there are a number of terrorist groups in the country that pose threats to Central Asian countries.
“The situation in Afghanistan can spread to the entire region, particularly to Central Asian countries, because a vast number of terrorist groups that have operated as powerful arm of al Qaeda are deployed in the northern parts of Afghanistan,” Nabil said.
Meanwhile, former president Hamid Karzai appreciated the Tajik leader's remarks on Afghanistan and said during his presidency, he maintained good relations with Kabul.

President Ashraf Ghani on Friday evening spoke on phone with US President Joe Biden and discussed “discussed the evolving but continuing relationship between the two countries.”
“President Biden reassured me that support for the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) will continue. We have confidence that they will protect and defend Afghanistan,” President Ghani said in a tweet.
“We stressed on the importance of the Afghans coming together for peace and security,” Ghani said.
The White House in a statement said that President Biden and President Ghani discussed the situation in Afghanistan and reaffirmed their commitment to an enduring bilateral partnership.
Biden emphasized continued US support, including development and humanitarian aid, for the Afghan people, including women, girls, and minorities, the statement said. 
Biden and Ghani agreed that the Taliban’s current offensive is in direct contradiction to the movement’s claim to support a negotiated settlement of the conflict, the statement said.
Biden also reaffirmed the US’s commitment to continue supporting the Afghan security forces to defend themselves. 
According to the statement, the FY2022 request to Congress for $3.3 billion for the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund prioritizes $1 billion to ensure the Afghan Air Force and Special Mission Wing have the capabilities and maintenance to support ongoing combat operations, $1 billion to purchase and deliver key supplies for Afghan forces such as fuel, ammunition, and spare parts; and $700 million to fund continued payment of salaries for Afghan soldiers.
They deplored the loss of innocent Afghan lives, including through continued targeted killings, as well as displacement of the civilian population, looting and burning of buildings, destruction of vital infrastructure, and damage to communication networks, the statement said. 
Biden urged continued work for unity among Afghan leaders on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the values on which it is based, the statement said. 
“The two leaders discussed the importance of Afghans coming together to support their common interest in security and peace, and President Biden underscored continued US diplomatic engagement in support of a durable and just political settlement,” the statement added.
This comes amidst a sharp rise in violence. President Ghani has said that he has prepared a security plan based on which the current security situation will change once it is applied.
Based on the new plan, the ANDSF will beef up security measures for major cities, airports, highways, strategic locations and border towns.
Over 200 districts, including some key border towns, have fallen to the Taliban in the last two months. But the government has assured to retake the districts, especially the border towns in Herat and Kandahar provinces.

Envoys Seek End to Taliban’s ‘Military Offensive’
","
The special representatives from the United States, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, NATO, Norway, and the United Kingdom met in Rome on 22 July to discuss the situation in Afghanistan and the developments in the Afghan peace negotiations after the latest round of high-level talks in Doha last week, reiterating on an immediate end to violence in the country.
The envoys in a statement said they are committed to a strong partnership with Afghanistan and will be closely monitoring ongoing developments in this new phase of transition with the withdrawal of international forces.
They said that the people of Afghanistan have suffered for too long from conflict and that they are deeply concerned about the high levels of violence, the Taliban’s military offensive, and the number of reported serious human rights abuses and violations alleged in communities most affected by the ongoing armed conflict across the country.
“We call on all parties to reduce violence and protect civilians, respecting their obligations under international humanitarian law. We call on the Taliban to end their military offensive, and on both the Islamic Republic and the Taliban to engage meaningfully in the peace process. We reiterate the urgency of reaching a ceasefire to ensure the success of negotiations, and we acknowledge the sacrifices of the Afghan security forces,” the envoys said in the statement. 
The envoys said there is no military solution to the conflict in Afghanistan and that they stand by UNSC resolution 2513 (2020), and they do not support any government in Afghanistan imposed through military force.
“We express our full support to an inclusive Afghan-owned and Afghan-led peace process with full and meaningful participation of women that leads to a just and durable political settlement,” the envoys said. 
“We also highlight five elements of a final settlement that are most critical: (1) inclusive governance; (2) the right to elect political leaders; (3) protections for human rights, including rights of women, youth and minorities; (4) commitments on counter-terrorism, including to ensure that Afghanistan does not again serve as a safe haven for terrorists; and (5) adherence to international law, including international humanitarian law. We emphasize that international support to any future government will depend, at least in part, on adherence to these five elements,” they said in the statement. 
The special representatives said they intend to maintain their support for Afghan institutions, including defense and security forces, to address the country’s urgent needs. 
“We also reiterate that future assistance to Afghanistan is dependent on good governance and a commitment to the rule of law and human rights, including preservation of the gains made by women and girls over the past two decades, as well as the government taking meaningful steps to tackle corruption and to meeting commitments made at the November 2020 Geneva Conference,” the envoys said.
The envoys welcomed the talks held in Doha on July 17 and 18 between senior leaders of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban. 
“We further welcome the declared commitment of the two sides to accelerate negotiations toward an inclusive political settlement and to meet again in the near future. We believe future meetings should focus on core issues that will be fundamental to reaching an inclusive political settlement,” they said.
The envoys said they acknowledged that reaching a final political settlement, including on the Constitution, will likely take time. “We urge the two sides to agree on a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire and on foundational principles for the future Afghan State and details of transitional governing arrangements until a final political settlement is reached. We emphasize that any transitional governing arrangements must be inclusive, respect the rights of all Afghans in line with Afghanistan’s international commitments and also uphold counter-terrorism commitments,” they added.
The envoys said they welcome in particular the commitments made by the Taliban yesterday to inclusive governance, respecting human rights including the rights of women and minorities, to abide by international law, including international humanitarian law, and upholding counter-terrorism commitments. They said that they also welcome the Taliban’s openness to negotiate a mechanism for representative government with the Islamic Republic negotiation team.
“We call on the two parties to negotiate in good faith in order to reach a just and durable political settlement. To promote progress in the negotiations, we support any third-party facilitation or mediation welcomed by the two sides,” the special representatives said.
The envoys asked the Taliban and the Islamic Republic to deliver on their commitments (1) to prevent the use of Afghan soil by al Qaeda, Da’esh or other terrorist groups from launching attacks against, or threatening the security of, any other country; and (2) not to host members of these groups nor to allow them to recruit, train, fundraise or transit through Afghanistan.
“We urge the Taliban to reduce violence, uphold their commitments to protect Afghanistan’s infrastructure, protect civilians and cooperate on humanitarian assistance, particularly as the Afghan people suffer acutely from the effects of COVID-19 and drought, in addition to violence. We call on the Taliban to allow and facilitate, without preconditions and consistent with international humanitarian law, access for delivery of humanitarian aid, to areas under their control,” they said.
The envoys said that they believe that Afghanistan can contribute to regional and international stability and connectivity. They asked Afghanistan’s neighbors to intensify their support to the Afghan people and to contribute to a lasting peace settlement and economic development in the interests of all.
“We also call upon all parties to ensure the safety of foreign embassies and other diplomatic missions, multilateral agencies, media representatives, airports and non-governmental organizations and their Afghan and international staff. We particularly appreciate Turkey’s readiness and commitment to assist with airport security as needed,” the envoys said.

UN Warns of Expanding Threat from Daesh, al Qaeda in Afghanistan
","
The United Nations in a new report is warning that the threat from terror groups such as Daesh and al Qaeda is expanding in many places in Afghanistan where the security situation remains fragile with uncertainty surrounding the peace process and a risk of further deterioration.
The report by the UN Security Council, published Thursday, says that despite territorial, leadership, manpower and financial losses during 2020 in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces, Daesh’s Khorasan branch, or ISIL-K, has moved into other provinces, including Nuristan, Badghis, Sar-e-Pul, Baghlan, Badakhshan, Kunduz and Kabul, where fighters have formed sleeper cells.
The report says that the group has strengthened its positions in and around Kabul, where it conducts most of its attacks, targeting minorities, activists, government employees and personnel of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces. 
The report says that most recently, Daesh claimed responsibility for the brutal attack of 8 June, when 10 humanitarian deminers working with HALO Trust in Baghlan Province were killed and 16 were injured.
“In its efforts to resurge, ISIL-K has prioritized the recruitment and training of new supporters; its leaders also hope to attract intransigent Taliban and other militants who reject the Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan between the United States and the Taliban and to recruit fighters from the Syrian Arab Republic, Iraq and other conflict zones,” the report says. 
The report states that the estimates of the strength of Daesh’s Khorasan branch range widely, with one member state reporting between 500 and 1,500 fighters and another stating that it may rise to as many as 10,000 over the medium term. 
“One member state stressed that ISIL-K was largely underground and clandestine,” the report says. “Its leader, Shahab al-Muhajir, alias Sanaullah, cooperates with Sheikh Tamim, head of the al-Sadiq office.”
The report says that Tamim and his office are tasked by Daesh core to oversee the network connecting the Khorasan branch with Daesh presences in the wider region.
The UN report says that as reported by the UN Monitoring Team in its twelfth report to the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011), al Qaeda is present in at least 15 Afghan provinces, primarily in the eastern, southern and south-eastern regions. 
The report says that al Qaeda’s weekly Thabat newsletter reports on its operations inside Afghanistan. 
Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) operates under Taliban protection from Kandahar, Helmand and Nimroz provinces, the report says. 
Since the death of Asim Umar in 2019, AQIS has been led by Osama Mahmood, the report says, adding that the group consists mainly of Afghan and Pakistani nationals, but also individuals from Bangladesh, India and Myanmar. 
On 30 March, AQIS commander Dawlat Bek Tajiki (alias Abu Mohammad al-Tajiki) was killed by Afghan forces in Gyan district of Paktika province. 
“Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri is assessed by member states to be alive but ailing in Afghanistan. SayfAl Adl, his most likely successor, is reported to remain in the Islamic Republic of Iran,” the report states. 
Member states differ as to what Al Adl’s options would be if he was called upon to succeed al-Zawahiri, but most assess that he would have to move and that basing himself in Afghanistan might not be an option, the report says.
The leadership succession calculations of Al Qaeda are complicated by the peace process in Afghanistan where, under the Doha agreement of February 2020, the Taliban is committed to suppressing any international terrorist threat, the report says, but adds that it is unclear whether Sayf-Al Adl would be able to travel to Afghanistan to take up the position of leader of Al Qaeda. 
The report mentions that some member states point to his history of living and operating in Africa and assess that he might choose to base himself there.
The report also says that the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, IMU, faces financial difficulties and a Taliban that is less accommodating than it used to be.

US Calls on Taliban to Engage in ‘Serious Negotiations’
","
The United States has called on the Taliban “to engage in serious negotiations” after the group’s insistence that they will not agree on ceasefire and peace unless there is an agreement on a new government in Afghanistan.
“We call on the Taliban to engage in serious negotiations to determine a political roadmap for Afghanistan's future that leads to a just and durable settlement,” US State Department’s deputy spokesperson Jalina Porter said.
“A negotiated settlement between the Islamic Republic and the Taliban is the only way to end 40 years of war and bring Afghans to peace that they seek and deserve,” she added. 
She said that the world will not accept the imposition by force of a government in Afghanistan, adding that “legitimacy and assistance for any Afghan government can only be possible if that government has a basic right, basic respect excuse me for human rights.”
Porter also underscored that the violence must end against the Afghans who worked alongside Americans in the Afghanistan war.
“Recent reports of violence and atrocities against interpreters and other Afghans indicate local Taliban forces are showing little regard for human life and human rights on the ground,” she said. “We vehemently condemn these targeted attacks, the destruction of vital infrastructure, as well as other attacks against the people of Afghanistan.”
CNN on Friday reported that an Afghan interpreter for US Army was beheaded by the Taliban in May.
“The Taliban must go beyond issuing statements denying territorial offenses and targeted attacks,” Porter said. “If this is truly not Taliban policy, their leadership should condemn these atrocities and violations of basic rights.” 
She said the Taliban “must proactively prevent their forces from carrying out these actions on the ground, reiterating on US’s call for an immediate end to ongoing violence.
This comes as in an interview with The Associated Press, Suhail Shaheen, Taliban spokesman and a member of the group’s negotiating team, said the Taliban will lay down their weapons when a negotiated government acceptable to all sides in the conflict is installed in Kabul and Ghani’s government is gone.

33 People Killed in Taliban-held Areas in Kandahar: Watchdog
","
Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) on Saturday said that 33 people were assassinated in Kandahar over the past two weeks.
“Religious scholars, tribal elders, civil society activists, journalists and human rights defenders and female journalists are being sacrificed in targeted attacks,” said Zabihullah Farhang, spokesman to AIHRC.
“Any group that resorts on harming civilians is conducting a war crime under the rules of war,” said Laal Gul Laal, the head of Human Rights Organization.
The Human Rights Watch (HRW), meanwhile, in a report said that hundreds of people in the districts that were fallen to the Taliban in Afghanistan’s southern Kandahar province have been detained and some were killed by the group over their alleged associated with the Afghan government and the country’s security institutions.
The watchdog said that the Taliban have reportedly killed some detainees, including relatives of provincial government officials and members of Afghanistan’s National Police (ANP) and the Afghan National army (ANA).
Citing reports by the journalists, the Human Rights Watch said that after Taliban forces took control of Kandahar’s Spin Boldak border crossing with Pakistan on July 8, and the Spin Boldak district center on July 16, they conducted searches to identify residents who have worked for the local government or security forces.
“Taliban forces that control areas around Kandahar city have carried out similar searches and have evicted some residents. Local media have reported that the Taliban have taken more than 300 people into custody and have detained them in unidentified locations,” HRW said.
“There are grave concerns that Taliban forces in Kandahar may commit further atrocities to retaliate against the government and security forces.” said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Taliban leaders have denied responsibility for any abuses, but growing evidence of expulsions, arbitrary detentions, and killings in areas under their control are raising fears among the population.”
The Taliban have told members of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), including police who have been the principal security force in Kandahar, to register with them to receive letters guaranteeing their safety, the HRW said, quoting a local activist in Kandahar.
According to the report, Taliban forces also gone to the homes of some ANDSF members who had registered, taken them into custody, and killed an unknown number of them.
Local activists said that in one case, on July 9, the Taliban shot and killed a man named Nangiyali, in front of family members. He was a resident of Sarposa, Kandahar, who had previously worked with the police, said HRW.
“The UN, US, and other countries engaged in the peace talks should urgently call on the Taliban leadership to stop these killings and other abuses,” Gossman said.
On Thursday sources familiar with the report said that  Unidentified gunmen reportedly have killed ""over a 100 civilians"" in Spin Boldak district of Kandahar province.
The Afghan Ministry of Interior (MoI) confirmed the report, saying these civilians were killed without any reason.
The Afghan government blamed the Taliban for the murder of civilians.
“The brutal terrorists on the order of their Punjabi bosses (Pakistan) ambushed the homes of the innocent Afghans in certain areas of Spin Boldak, looted the homes and martyred 100 innocent people,” said Mirwais Stanekzai, a spokesman for the Ministry of Interior.
“They must respect intentional laws and the law of war on the battlefields,” said legal expert Qazi Abdul Rahim.
“If revenge continues in this country, they (Taliban) must remember that the nation will retaliate against them,” said former governor of Helmand Amir Mohammad Akhundzada.
The US Department of State has also raised concerns over reports of extrajudicial killings by the Taliban.
“Recent reports of violence and atrocities against interpreters and other Afghan activist indicate local Taliban forces are showing little regard towards human rights and human rights on the ground. We condemns these targeted attacks, the destruction of infrastructure as well as other attacks against the people of Afghanistan,” said Jalina Porter, the deputy State Department spokesperson.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said his country stands ready to work with Pakistan to promote the building of a closer community for a shared future in the new era.
At a joint press briefing after the meeting, Wang said the two countries agreed to continue the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, strengthen coordination in international and regional affairs, jointly oppose hegemonism and unilateralism, and maintain the international system with the United Nations as the core and the international order based on the international law, according to Dawn news.
On the current situation in Afghanistan, Wang said that as neighboring countries of Afghanistan, both China and Pakistan are most directly affected by the situation in Afghanistan.
After in-depth communication, the two sides decided to carry out joint campaigns in five areas, Wang said.
He said the two countries agree to strive for peace to avoid the spread of war as a top priority, actively promote peace through talks and advance intra-Afghan talks, work together to combat terrorism and push all major forces in Afghanistan away from terrorism, promote coordination and cooperation among neighboring countries of Afghanistan, and urge the United States to earnestly fulfill its responsibilities for the peace and reconstruction of Afghanistan.
The fourth China-Afghanistan-Pakistan Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue was held in Guiyang earlier this June where the foreign ministers reached a consensus on the Afghan peace and reconciliation process, as well as trilateral cooperation.
During their meetings in Chengdu, the two sides reiterated their stances.
“The US hasty troop withdrawal has not reached its target of quelling terrorism in Afghanistan, nor has it brought peace to the region. Instead, it created a new security black hole. It is clearly irresponsible,” Wang said.
“The foreign minister has said on Afghanistan the five-point strategy that he just spelled out, we are leaving it on how to move forward and that's the conclusion on the discussion that they had today, that Pakistan completely endorses the five-point strategy on Afghanistan,” Qureshi said.

Next High-Level Meeting on Peace Expected in August: Sources
","
The next meeting of high-level delegations from both the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban will take place at the beginning of next month, sources close to the negotiating teams in Doha said.
The first meeting was held on July 16 and lasted for two days, during which delegates agreed to continue their meetings and expedite the peace efforts. However, attendees failed to reach an agreement on a ceasefire.
The sources said that efforts will be made through these meetings to achieve a framework for peace talks as the withdrawal of US and coalition forces is expected to be completed by the end of August. 
“It will be helpful if an authoritative team attends the meeting this time, but if the delegation has less authority, it will not have an outcome,” said former Taliban commander Sayed Akbar Agha.
The efforts for peace come as fighting continues on multiple fronts that have led to the fall of a large swath of territory to the Taliban.
Abdullah Abdullah, head of the High Council for National Reconciliation, in an interview with Al Jazeera, said the conflict in Afghanistan has no military solution.
“Since we think that peaceful settlement is much, much better option than the continuation of the war, we will continue to make these efforts,” Abdullah said.
But some analysts said the efforts in Doha for peace talks should be expedited and it should not take more time.
“The ordinary people will be damaged as much as the negotiations are prolonged. It is better that these talks are expedited,” said Gul Rahman Qazi, head of an Afghan political party.

Residents Claim Taliban Killed 5 People in Kabul District
","
Residents of Shakar Dara district, north of Kabul city, claim that five people--four security force members and a police hospital employee--were taken by the Taliban and then killed by the group.
The residents said the incident occurred in Haji Paik village in Shakar Dara on Friday night as the Taliban conducted a two-hour search operation on a street in the village.
Some relatives of the victims said the five young men were first tortured by the Taliban and then killed.
The residents called it a crime against humanity and blamed the government for not providing security.
Many residents of the province were not prepared to talk on the record about the incident, but one of them, Humayun, said: “They were four or five who didn’t have military uniforms. They were taken far from here.”
Many family members of the victims were not ready to speak on the record about the incident. But a relative of one of the victims gave an account:
“They took out my cousin’s eyes with a ramrod, they also took out his tongue and ran over him with a car. He was also hit by bullets from his toes to his head,” said Abdul Rahman, a cousin of one of the victims.
Mayil Agha, a resident of the area, said the Taliban interrogated him on Friday night. He said the group set up a checkpoint in the village and for two hours they searched for government-related individuals to abduct.
“They were here from 7:30pm or 8:00pm to 10pm. No one was here to help. They killed five people today and they might take five more the next day. What should we do and where should we go?” said Mayil Agha.
Sayed Kamaluddin, an army member, and his brother Sayed Bahiruddin, who was a police solider in Zabul; Niaz Mohammad, a police officer; Ramish, a member of police special unit; and Sayid Rahim, an employee at a police hospital who had a monthly salary of 6,000 Afs (almost $80) and was the only breadwinner for his family, were the five individuals who were killed in the incident.
“They are strangers. They martyred their brothers under Pakistan’s order,” said Nadir, a Shakar Dara resident.
Among close family members of those killed in the incident, only an uncle of Sayed Rahim spoke on the record about what happened on Friday night in their village.
“Four or five bullets hit his forehead. And some were in his backbone. He lied on the ground in Dasht-e-Gul Dara area,” he said.
“The Taliban has some roots in Shakar Dara. A strong base has been established for Talibs here, and from here they can operate in the Kohdaman area and even in the city of Kabul,” said Lotfullah Quraishi, a former commander of public uprising forces.
Residents of the village said that security forces last night searched the houses affected by the incident, instead of going after the Taliban.
“The Taliban are stationed on the other side of the river. Why are you searching for them here?” said Mohammad Shakir, a resident of Haji Paik village.
“The perpetrators of the incident will be arrested soon,” Shakar Dara district governor Gawhar Khan Baburi said.
A Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said the incident is under investigation. He said security force members will not be safe unless they quit fighting.

'43 People Killed by Taliban' in Ghazni, Residents Claim
","
Residents of Malistan district in the central province of Ghazni claim that the Taliban shot and killed 43 civilians and security force members after the group attacked the district earlier this month. Similar occurrences have been reported in other areas as well.
Among those killed were two young men whose father said they were killed while leaving the area with their families and that they were not government employees or security force members.
“Taliban fighters after entering Malistan district committed war crimes and killed civilians who were not involved in the fighting. They attacked people’s homes and after looting their property, they burned residential houses,” said Mina Naderi, a civil society activist from Ghazni who read a joint statement from Malistan residents at a press conference in Kabul on Sunday.
“In the center of Malistan district, they (Taliban) also destroyed and looted shops,” she added.
The Taliban has rejected the claim by the residents.
Some of the displaced people who are in Kabul claimed that they have lost their family members in Taliban attacks, while others said their homes were damaged and destroyed in the fighting, forcing them to leave their areas.
Haji Nadir, caretaker of a 16-member family, said his sons Ramazan, 29, and Ishaq, 31, were killed by the Taliban 10 days ago when they were trying to leave the district with their families following an increase in fighting in the area.
“Who martyred the 40 civilians? Which stronghold were they in?” Nadir asked.
The two slain young men left behind five children who are now in Kabul. Figures show that at least 3,000 people have been displaced from Malistan district in the last 10 days following the Taliban attack. The eldest of the children is seven years old.
The spouses of the two young men said the Taliban blindfolded their husbands in front of their children, took them near a mosque in the area and then “opened fire on them.”
“They were taken out and were taken a bit far (from their home) and were martyred,” said Zulaikha, Ramazan Ali’s wife.
“We were on our way when we were stopped by the Taliban. The two were taken (Taliban) and both were killed,” said Jamal, Ishaq Ali’s wife.
Malistan’s displaced residents also claimed that Taliban fighters collected food from homes in the district and issued an announcement saying that going forward they will treat people, especially women, based on the “Islamic emirate” rules.

Govt Forces Leave District in Kunar, Fighting Continues in North
","
Sources said that security forces left Narai district in the eastern province of Kunar on Sunday due to lack of supplies and that fighting continues on other fronts, including Nijrab district in Kapisa where its central areas are still under Taliban influence.
“Narai district fell (to the Taliban) without resistance. This shows the weakness of the leadership of the security agencies,” said Jawed Safi, an MP from Kunar.
Officials also reported fighting between government forces and the Taliban in Chahar Dara district in the northern province of Kunduz.
Officials in Parwan said that Taliban attacks were pushed back in some areas on the outskirts of Charikar city.
“The Taliban’s weapons and bodies were left there. Some of them were wounded. Their attack was thwarted,” Parwan governor Fazluddin Ayar said.
Meanwhile, fighting was reported in parts of Hazrat Sultan district in Samangan province.
“Progress will continue in the Ghaznigak area and the highway. These areas have been cleared of the enemy and the operation continues,” said a police commander in Samangan.
Security forces left Nijrab district in Kapisa – 100 kilometers north of Kabul – a week ago. Some MPs from Kapisa said that dozens of public uprising forces have taken up arms against the Taliban but so far the district has not been cleared.
“We should admit that there were some issues among the public uprising forces from the past and I hope that going forward, these problems are solved,” said Mir Afzal Haidari, head of the Parliament's defense commission.
In Takhar province in northeastern Afghanistan 16 districts fell to the Taliban two weeks ago and clashes are still underway on the outskirts of Taluqan city, the provincial capital.
“We should hit the enemy. Who is this enemy? A few Pakistanis? Or few other foreigners? Or a few Taliban? We have a strong force,” said Abdul Latif Omari, a border forces commander in Takhar.
The Ministry of Defense said that efforts are underway to retake the fallen areas. The ministry added that 170 Taliban fighters were killed in the last 24 hours.
“Our forces are in better positions. Areas under the Taliban will become more limited every day,” said Fawad Aman, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry.
The Taliban has rejected the figures provided by the ministry.

Insecurity in Parwan Village Linked to Illegal Armed Groups
","
A special unit of the country’s intelligence agency, NDS, conducted an operation in Rabat village in Parwan province last week in which 10 people were killed, following concerns raised by local residents linking insecurity in the area to the existence of illegal armed groups.
There have been many reports about the activities of illegal armed groups in some areas recently.
One of those killed in the operation was a former aide to Almas Zahid, a presidential adviser. He criticized the operation but claimed that the people killed had no relations with him.
“They are from our area. One of them who was old and was killed was my bodyguard 20 years ago,” he said.
“If the unit went on the operation to search for them, they should explain. If the unit conducted the operation for others, they should also explain. When a unit conducts an operation in a place, they should not kill everyone. They should make arrests,” Zahid added.
The assassination of an Afghan Air Force member also recently occurred in the village of Rabat. And in Bagram district, where the village is located, a blast targeted a university lecturers’ bus last month, attacks targeted power pylons, and some targeted killings also took place--all of which Parwan residents said were perpetrated by illegal armed men.
“It is concerning--it has created concern among Parwan residents,” said Maihan, a Parwan resident, referring to the existence of illegal armed men in the province.
“They fire weapons at night and conduct assassinations and armed robbery,” said Changir, a Parwan resident, referring to illegal armed men in the province.
The NDS did not provide information about the 01 Unit operation in Rabat village in Parwan.

US General Pledges More Air Support to Afghan Forces
","
As violence continues to increase in the country, a top US general on Sunday said the United States will continue to carry out airstrikes to support Afghan National Defense and Security Forces facing Taliban attacks.
Addressing a news conference in Kabul on Sunday evening, US CENTCOM Commander Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, who met with President Ashraf Ghani on the same day, said Afghanistan is going to face hard days ahead, but added that “there is a path that could lead us to a political solution to this war.”
“The United States has increased airstrikes in the support of Afghan forces over the last several days and we’re prepared to continue this heightened level of support in the coming weeks if the Taliban continue their attacks,” McKenzie said.
Going into details about the US’s support to Afghan forces, McKenzie said, “Specific support that I reassured the government that we will continue to provide includes airstrikes in defense of ANDSF forces under attack by the Taliban, contract logistic support both here in Kabul and over-the-horizon in the region, funding for them, intelligence sharing and advising and assisting through security consultation at the strategic level.”
He said he discussed the Afghan forces security plan for the defense of Afghanistan with the acting defense minister Gen. Bismillah Mohammadi.
President Ghani last week said that he has prepared a security plan that will change the situation within next three to six months.
“I was also here to reassure them about continued United States support for their security efforts,” he said. “We had very good dialogue on the government’s defense plan to stabilize the security situation.”
This comes as the Pentagon last week announced that the US troops withdrawal will complete by end of August.
He said the government of Afghanistan faces a strong test in the days ahead.
“The Taliban are attempting to create a sense of inevitability about their campaign but they’re wrong. There is no preordained conclusion to this fight. Taliban victory is not inevitable,” he noted.
There have been some meetings between the Afghan Republic and the Taliban’s negotiators in the last two weeks.
The next meeting of high-level delegations from both the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban will take place at the beginning of next month, sources close to the negotiating teams in Doha said.
The first meeting was held on July 16 and lasted for two days, during which delegates agreed to continue their meetings and expedite the peace efforts. However, attendees failed to reach an agreement on a ceasefire.

Civilian Casualties in Afghanistan Hit Record Levels: UN
","
Resulting from a spike in violence in May that corresponded with the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan, the civilian casualties reported in the country for the first half of 2021 have reached record levels, the UN said in a report released on Monday. 
The UN has warned that without significant de-escalation, 2021 will witness the highest ever number of documented civilian casualties in a single year since UNAMA recording began.  
The UN report said that 1,659 civilians were killed and 3,254 others were wounded, which is a 47 percent increase compared to the same period in 2020.  
Of serious concern is the acute rise in the number of civilians killed and injured in the period from May 1, with almost as many civilian casualties in the May-June period as recorded in the entire preceding four months, according to the report. 
The number of civilian casualties during May and June –783 killed and 1,609 wounded--is the highest for those months since UNAMA began its systematic documentation in 2009.  
The period January-April 2021 saw 2,791 civilian casualties (876 killed and 1,915 injured), said the UN. 
“I implore the Taliban and Afghan leaders to take heed of the conflict's grim and chilling trajectory and its devastating impact on civilians. The report provides a clear warning that unprecedented numbers of Afghan civilians will perish and be maimed this year if the increasing violence is not stemmed,"" said Deborah Lyons, the Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Afghanistan.  
The UN envoy, who is also the head of UNAMA, called on the Taliban and Afghan leaders to ""intensify your efforts at the negotiating table, stop the Afghan against Afghan fighting"" and to ""protect the Afghan people and give them hope for a better future.”  
“The pursuit of a military solution will only increase the suffering of the Afghan people,” the report said. 
The UN urged the parties to follow their obligations under international law to protect civilians. 
The report noted that what is“particularly shocking” and of ""deep concern"" is that women, boys and girls made up ""close to half of all civilian casualties in the first half of 2021,"" it said. 
“Comprising 46 percent of all civilian casualties, 32 percent were children – 1,682 in total (468 killed and 1,214 injured) and 14 percent were women – 727 in total (219 killed and 508 injured),” the report said, adding: “It is sickening to report that more women and more children were killed and wounded than ever before recorded by UNAMA for the first half of any calendar year.” 
""Anti-Government Elements (AGEs) were responsible for 64 percent of the total civilian casualties: 39 percent by Taliban, nearly nine percent by Daesh and 16 percent by undetermined AGEs,"" the report said. 
""Pro-Government Forces (PGFs) were responsible for 25 percent of civilian casualties: 23 percent by Afghan national security forces, and two percent by pro-Government armed groups or undetermined PGFs,"" according to the report. 
UNAMA attributed 11 percent of all civilian casualties to ""crossfire"" during ground engagements where the exact party responsible could not be determined and other incident types, including unattributable unexploded ordnance/explosive remnants of war.  
UNAMA is also concerned about the ""increasing number of reports of killing, ill-treatment, persecution and discrimination in communities affected by the current fighting and its aftermath,"" the report said, adding that it is ""particularly important, especially during times of heightened conflict, that all parties respect the human rights and dignity of people and prevent such abuses and violations.""

Afghan Forces Retake Key District in Balkh

Afghan forces retook control of Kaldar district in the northern province of Balkh as clashes continue near the provincial centers in Ghazni, Faryab and Takhar provinces. 
The Hairatan border town, which is a key trade gateway and a port between Afghanistan and Uzbekistan, is located in Kaldar district. The district is located along the Amu River and shares a border with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.
The district fell to the Taliban a month ago. It was retaken by security forces and members of the public uprising forces on Monday.
“Our forces have made good progress. We will make efforts to protect civilians,” Balkh governor’s spokesman Adil Shah Adil said.
“We had clashes in 25 provinces in which the Afghan forces made progress,” said ANDSF spokesman Gen. Ajmal Omar Shinwari.
Shinwari said that 1,500 Taliban fighters were killed and 800 more were wounded in Afghan forces operations over the past week. The Taliban has rejected the claim.
Sources said that parts of Maimana city in Faryab witnessed mortar and rocket attacks by the Taliban on Sunday night.
The sources said that 16 people including three civilians were killed in the attacks.
“The situation is tough. We often hear the sounds of firing, including mortar and rockets,” said Ahmad Jamshid, a resident of Maimana.
Some residents of Takhar said the situation in the province is concerning. Some displaced families from the province describe very challenging circumstances.
“It has been more than a month that the situation got worse here. We have left our homes,” said Majid, a displaced resident of Takhar.
“People left their homes and property,” said Saifullah, a displaced resident of Takhar.
Ghazni residents said clashes on the outskirts of the city of Ghazni have affected their daily life, especially during the night.
“People don’t feel safe. They are afraid of mines, and bullets that might hit them when they are out,” said Abdul Rahim, a resident of Ghazni.
“There is fear among the people when they are traveling because the Taliban are on one side and the government is on the other,” said Reza Husain, a Ghazni resident.
This comes as First Vice President Amrullah Saleh in a social media post on Monday blamed Pakistan for supporting the Taliban and said the group has not changed.

'Lack of Coordination' of Public Forces Cited in Kapisa Losses
","
Former Kapisa governor Mehrabuddin Safi said that weak coordination among public uprising forces led to the fall of many key areas to the Taliban in the province, including Nijrab district.
Safi said that the presence of a large number of Taliban fighters also led to the fall of the Kapisa districts.
Security forces left key parts of Nijrab districts two weeks ago, while the Tagab and Ala Sai districts in the province fell to the group earlier in the month.
Over the past two weeks, clashes have been underway in parts of Nijrab to retake the district, but no progress has been made so far. Hundreds of district residents have been displaced due to the clashes.
“Some individuals belonged to Mr. Mirdad. A large number of them. And some others are under Gul Akbar’s command, who has a presence in the Afghania and Pachagan areas. And 100 more people are from the Giyawa area in Njirab led by commander Shitab and commander Nawab,” former Kapisa governor Mehrabuddin Safi said. “These forces are in fact not under a unified command.”
The deputy governor of Kapisa, Aziz-ur-Rahman Tawab, was killed in a clash with the Taliban in Nijrab district on July 16. The fall of key parts of the district happened three days after his death.
Officials and MPs in Kapisa said that at least 1,300 members of the public uprising forces have joined the fight against the Taliban, but sources from the province said the numbers are far less than reported.
Sources said that some Kapisa lawmakers and officials have taken at least 20 million Afs to fund these forces over the last month, but only a small number of these forces are on the frontlines against the Taliban.
“They have been divided. Some to Mr. A, and some to Mr. B ... 100 persons belong to one and 300 belong to another,” said Haidar Haidar, a Kapisa resident.
However, Mir Dad Nijrabi, an MP from Kapisa, leads members of the public uprising forces and said these forces have fought against the Taliban and have made sacrifices.
“They are on the ground right now. They are fighting the enemy and none of them have surrendered to the enemy or handed over their equipment and weapons,” Nijrabi said.

The United States, Canada and some other countries have vowed to evacuate Afghans who worked with them during the last 20 years.

Ordinary Afghans Still Hopeful for Future Despite Violence
","
Almost a week after a rocket attack on the Presidential Palace during Eid prayers, ordinary Afghans criticized those commit such acts and said despite the ongoing violence they still remain hopeful about a brighter future and they will make efforts for it.
TOLOnews reporter Khaled Nikzad interviewed residents of Parwan-e-Se area in the north of Kabul from where at least three rockets were fired toward the Presidential Palace on July 20. These residents said the attempts to impose violence and destruction by terrorist groups on them will not affect their will and hope for a brighter future for Afghanistan.
Some of those interviewed were students from a school that is located near the area from where the rockets were fired.
“We were disappointed. I wanted to go to school but my mother asked me not to go because another incident might happen. I told her that I will go to school to build my country,” said Sadaf, a student.
“Our students are thinking about building this country, but the Taliban always thinks about violence and the destruction of Afghanistan,” said Maryam, a schoolteacher.
The rocket attack sparked a widespread reaction within the country and abroad. The Ministry of Interior Affairs said last week that the main perpetrator behind the incident had been arrested.  The ministry blamed the Taliban for the incident, but the group has denied involvement.
At a bakery in the same area, Mahbubullah, a baker, said he has bitter experiences from the war, but he hopes that Afghanistan will achieve peace.
“Peace is good if it comes. It will be in our favor. For our next generation and next generations,” Mahbubullah said.
“Their aim is destruction, killing, insecurity and to create fear among the people, nothing else,” said Haji Farid, a Kabul resident.
The Afghan government has not yet completed its assessment of the incident in which three rockets landed near the Presidential Palace when the Eid prayers were underway.
“Terrorist attacks are complicated in the world and as it gets complicated, their prevention becomes difficult, but what is evident is that terrorists do not even have respect for prayers,” the ANDSF spokesman Gen. Ajmal Shinwari said.
“The Taliban should respect the citizens' basic rights, recognize them as it is the demand of all rights watchdogs and the people,” said Zabihullah Farhang, a media official of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission.

The arrest of four journalists in Kandahar by the National Directorate of Security, NDS, the country’s intelligence agency, has sparked reactions from watchdog organizations who say the four must be released and the reason for their detention should be made clear. 
Three of the journalists--Bismillah Watandost, Qudrat Sultani and Mohib Obaidi--work for Radi Millat Ghag, and Sanaullah Siyam is a local cameraman in Kandahar. They were arrested by the NDS when they returned from Spin Boldak district on Monday where they went to investigate claims of civilian deaths at the hands of the Taliban. 
“Whenever a reporter makes a mistake, the media violations commission should decide and approve that he has made a mistake and then he can be arrested,” said Samiullah Ghairatmal, head of the Nai office in Kandahar. Nai is an organization supporting open media in Afghanistan. 
“Journalists are from among the people and are working for the people. I hope that the government remains committed to freedom of the press and releases the journalists as soon as possible,” said Shams Omar, a reporter in Kandahar. 
Kandahar journalists said their colleagues should be released. 
“Journalists are the eyes and ears of the people. They should be released,” said Farid Alizai, a local journalist in Kandahar. 
“No hurdle should be made in the way of journalists’ activities,” said Mohammad Yar, a journalist in Kandahar. 
Amnesty International and other watchdog organizations also criticized the arrest and said it is in contravention of the law. 
“They should share with the people the reasons that these journalists were arrested to determine whether there is a legal basis or not,” said Lal Gul Lal, head of the Human Rights Organization of Afghanistan. 
“If the arrest of journalists continues, we will witness restrictions on the freedom of press by the government which will be in contravention of its commitments to the international community,” said Mujib Khalwatgar, CEO of Nai. 
The Ministry of Interior Affairs said interrogations of the four journalists are underway. 
“There is evidence against the four journalists who have been arrested on charges of supporting enemy propaganda in Kandahar. The security agencies are conducting their assessment based on the law,” the Interior Ministry’s spokesman Mirwais Stanekzai said.

NATO Chief Reiterates Support for Afghanistan
","
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday said there is a need for a political settlement to end the conflict in Afghanistan.
""The security situation in Afghanistan remains deeply challenging, and requires a negotiated settlement. NATO will continue to support Afghanistan, including with funding; civilian presence; and out-of-country training,” tweeted Stoltenberg after speaking on the phone with President Ashraf Ghani.
This comes as the Afghan National Security and Defense Forces (ANDSF) continue to fight the Taliban in at least 20 provinces.
The Taliban has captured the center of Barg-e-Matal district in Nuristan province in eastern Afghanistan, and reportedly also attacked Taluqan city, the center of northern Takhar province yesterday.
“The situation is getting worse in Taluqan city day by day, the war and violence have increased,” said Zabihullah, a resident in Taluqan.
“The Taliban are committing all sorts of atrocities in their areas which are very shocking,” said Abdullah Qarloq, the governor of Takhar.
Security sources said that at least 20 civilians and military personnel have been killed in the past week in fighting in Takhar.
“We have statistics which show that 149 civilians and military personnel were transferred to the hospital,” said Dr. Hassan Basij, the head of Takhar's hospital.
New clashes have also been reported in the northern province of Kapisa.
“25 Taliban fighters were killed and wounded during the battle, four members of the public uprising forces and two civilians were also killed,” said Shaqayeq Shorish, a spokesman for the Kapisa police.
Fighting was also reported between the security forces and the Taliban in eastern Afghanistan.
“With the fall of Barg-e-Matal, the Taliban are now moving toward Kamdish district which borders Pakistan,” said Ismail Atikan, MP.
Meanwhile, the Taliban have confirmed that Abdul Haq Omari, the son of Mohammad Nabi Omar, a member of the Taliban’s negotiating team, has been killed in a battle with the security forces in Paktia.
“Our impression, and the impression of the world, is that the war is not the solution, if the war was a solution, the Taliban would have obtained their goal during these 20 years,” said acting Defense Minister Bismillah Mohammadi.
Meanwhile, the killing of prominent Afghan comedian Khasha Zuwan Kandahari by the Taliban has sparked strong condemnation from social media users in Afghanistan.
The Taliban claimed that he had insulted the hostages and Taliban clerics and was killed during a crossfire. But footage on social media shows that the Taliban fighters arrested him, put him in a car, insulted him and threatened him with death.

Recent Violence Dampens Hopes for Peace: UN Official
","
A senior UN official in Kabul says that the rise in fighting has reduced hopes for peace talks and that the Afghan government and the Taliban should return to the table of negotiations and end the unprecedented violence.
Lisa Reefke, Senior Political Affairs Officer at the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), said that there is a need for international and regional consensus on Afghan peace to achieve results from it.
“The start of the Afghan peace negotiations in September last year generated hopes that talks will create space for Afghans to come together and negotiate a path to peace,” she said at a gathering of women in Kabul. “Today, action on the battlefield seems to compete with the peace negotiations in Doha.”
She added that women’s presence in the peace negotiations is necessary.
“UNAMA remains committed to supporting the parties within its mandate and in cooperation with all Afghans with the region and with the international community to move the peace process forward,” the UN official said.
Women at the event said that at least 57,000 women have invested in various areas in the last 20 years and have created over 130,000 jobs. They highlighted Afghan women’s abilities and said they can play a good role in the peace process.
“Many of these women have created hundreds of jobs for men and women,” said Manizha Wafiq, the chairperson of women’s chamber of commerce and industry.
“They can rarely travel to some provinces and remote villages to keep contact with farmers,” said Karima Sediqqi, the deputy chairperson of the chamber of commerce of women in the western zone of Afghanistan.
The participants of the event said there is a need for a meaningful role for women in any peace process and their achievements should not be compromised.

Parliament Commission: ONSC ‘Interfering’ in Security Affairs
","
The head of the Afghan Parliament’s internal security commission on Tuesday accused the Office of National Security Council (ONSC) of incompetence, saying interference by the ONSC in the affairs of the country’s security agencies is complicating the war effort on the battlefield. 
Khan Agha Rezaee, the head of Parliament’s internal security commission, said that officials from the security institutions do not have enough authority to act, stating that all affairs in the security entities are being monitored by the ONSC.
“The interference which exists today has led to the inability of the security and defense forces, they (NSC) shouldn’t be allowed to do so, they must only give suggestions and conduct monitoring,” said Khan Agha Rezaee, the head of Parliament’s internal security commission.
Although there has been no official comment from the ONSC regarding the allegations, legal experts have said that the ONSC is a policy-making and consultative institution, adding that dismissals and appointments in the security sector by the concerned institution are in contrast to the prevailing laws of the country.
The Afghan president has authority over the ONSC. However, the monitoring of decisions made by the council is done by the secretary,  who answers to the National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib. 
“What can resolve the issue is the structure of management and leadership. The Office of the National Security Council has changed into a 21st-century institution,” said Ashraf Ghani in March. 
However, the Parliament’s internal security commission says that Mohib has monopolized all the responsibilities and authorities of the security officials and that this interference has led to disharmony among the nation’s security entities.
“The plan that was carried out to appoint 100 district police chiefs and deploy them in the districts was not professional,” said Daud Amin, a former police commander in Khost who was recently dismissed from his job. 
Mohib has long been presiding over and leading the meetings of the heads of the security agencies.
The last press conference held by Mohib occurred three weeks ago. 
Meetings attended by the country's security and defense officials at Mohib’s office are held on a weekly basis to answer the questions raised by the media.
Despite repeated attempts, TOLOnews’ reporter did not manage to get a comment from Mohib’s office. But the former police commander of Khost province who was recently dismissed from his job has strongly criticized the way the ONSC undertakes the appointments of district governors and district police chiefs.
“By no means is the National Security Adviser allowed to issue appointments or dismissals or issue orders to the security forces,” said legal expert Rohullah Sakhizada.
In the past two decades, four people including Zalmay Rassoul, Rangin Dadafar Spanta, Mohammad Hanif Atmar, and the incumbent Hamdullah Mohib have served as National Security Adviser.

Ex-CIA Chief Petraeus Fears Potential Civil War in Afghanistan
","
Ex-CIA chief David Petraeus warned that the decision by President Joseph Biden’s administration to withdraw troops from Afghanistan may, in view of the current situation, plunge Afghanistan into a civil war.
Speaking at an online conference organized by the Middle East Institute, Petraeus said ""we accomplished the mission that took us to Afghanistan in the first place and that actually kept us there afterward,"" saying ""this was about eliminating the sanctuary in which Al Qaeda planned the 9/11 attacks and conducted the initial training of those attackers."" 
But his thoughts on the future were dire:
“To draw down our forces the way we have in Afghanistan ... I fear that it will usher back in a kind of very violent civil war that will result in millions of refugees, terrible loss of life and bloodshed, the targeting of those who helped us during our time in the country, and a variety of other challenges which will undoubtedly include the ability of Al-Qaeda and perhaps Islamic State (Daesh) to reestablish sanctuaries,” said Petraeus.
During the forum, Petraeus said that several years back there was a ""sustainable commitment"" of US troops in Afghanistan, and he noted that the US presence in Afghanistan provided a platform for regional counterterrorism efforts, such as operations in Pakistan.
Taking stock of the past twenty years, Petraeus mentioned poor governance, large-scale corruption and political disunity were challenges that arose, and he acknowledged that the inconsistency of US policy was also a problem.  
“There were missteps on the battlefield, there were certainly numerable cases of inadequate governing--all the way from the local to the national level, persuasive corruption was a huge issue over the years,” said Petraeus. “Political disunity has been an enormous frustration,” he said.
Petraeus also mentioned the sanctuaries that the Taliban have in Pakistan as a major factor, saying: “Their sanctuaries in Pakistan, there is a reason the Taliban leadership is called the Quetta Shura, because it is located outside Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan province in Pakistan, there is a reason that there is a Peshawar Shura again, and also the Haqqani network.”
Critics have consistently voiced concerns that the hasty withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan could trigger a new civil war in the country.

Pakistan Reopens Spin Boldak Crossing Held by Taliban
","
Pakistan reopened southwestern the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing in Kandahar province that is currently held by the Taliban, Pakistani customs officials said, as quoted by Reuters. 
The Pakistani government has allowed over 100 trucks carrying goods to cross into Afghanistan, the report said. 
The crossing has remained closed by Pakistan since fierce fighting for control of the Spin Boldak district erupted between Afghan government and the Taliban earlier this month. 
""Pakistan has opened its border with Afghanistan at Chaman today and resumed Afghan Transit Trade which was suspended since the last one month,"" Arif Kakar, a senior official of the Chaman pass said as quoted by Reuters. 
He said it would remain open six days a week.
The Afghan government has not yet commented on the move. 
The Finance Ministry on Monday said the Afghan government has lost 2.7 billion Afs (over $33 million) in customs revenue over the last four weeks as key border towns have fallen to the Taliban during this period. 
Over the past month, the government has lost control of key border towns including Islam Qala in Herat, Abu Nasr Farahi in Farah, Spin Boldak in Kandahar, Ai Khanum in Takhar, Dand Patan in Paktia and Shirkhan in Kunduz province.
The Finance Ministry said that the government has no control over seven customs departments in border towns. 
The Islam Qala customs area is one of the biggest trade gateways between Afghanistan and Iran and has been under Taliban control for the last 20 days. 
Rafi Tabe, a spokesman for the Ministry of Finance, said the collections from Jawza (May 22 to June 22, 2021) was 7.3 billion (at least $91 million) but this was reduced to 4.6 billion Afs ($57 million) in Saratan (June 23 to July 23). 
“The customs revenue is dependent on trading. It will have a negative impact on revenue if there are issues in trading,” he said. 
Private sector representatives said the issues around the border towns have affected traders’ willingness to import goods to the country through these gateways. 
Investors suggested that the government should take control of income-generating border towns to prevent further harm to importers.

PTM Leader Calls For End to 'Proxy War' in Afghanistan
","
Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) leader Manzoor Pashteen at a gathering in South Waziristan on Tuesday called for peace and an end to the ""proxy war"" in Afghanistan.
“Let the Afghans decide their future by themselves through talking and voting,” Pashteen said.
“PTM’s strong stance against the war in Afghanistan is because not only has it destroyed Afghanistan but also Pakhtunkhwa and indeed has kept the region in poverty and stagnation,” Pashteen said.
The people of Waziristan are against the war and insurgency, he said, adding that in ""the case of Afghanistan, the land of Waziristan has always been used and encouraging the people to jihad.""
“Negative interventions have ruined us all and Pakistan’s interventions have led us to destruction,” Pashteen said.


 



Saudi Arabia's foreign minister on Tuesday said he held talks with Pakistan in Islamabad on a range of issues, including Afghanistan, and he pledged to improve ties with the Islamic nation.
On Tuesday, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, following a meeting with his Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, at a press conference said: “We also had a good discussion on the evolving situation in Afghanistan, what to expect, what the challenges are, and what opportunities lie ahead of us. I am happy to share that our approach is the same.”
“We are looking at things in a similar, you know, our perspectives are same, our objectives are shared, and we have good discussion on that and generally, you know, discussing the region, we had a good discussion on the region,” he said.
Also, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said that ""Afghanistan of course was an issue of discussion and we will continue to work together to try and facilitate security and stability throughout both of our regions and we are, I think, committed to that and I hope we continue to work together.""
This comes amid an escalation of the war in Afghanistan by the Taliban following the US and NATO announcement of a troop withdrawal by September 11.
Ex-CIA chief David Petraeus warned that the decision by President Joseph Biden’s administration to withdraw troops from Afghanistan may, in view of the current situation, plunge Afghanistan into a civil war.

UN Envoy Warns Taliban of Intl Isolation If No Movement in Talks
","
Addressing the Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board (JCMB) meeting at the Presidential Palace on Wednesday, Deborah Lyons, the UN secretary general's special representative for Afghanistan, said that if there is no progress in the peace talks the world will not work with the Taliban. 
 ""If there is no movement at the negotiating table, and instead human rights abuses and worse still atrocities occur in districts they control, the Taliban will not be seen as a viable partner for the international community,"" said Lyons.  
Lyons said that the meeting takes place in extraordinary circumstances, with work to preserve the gains never more urgent or challenging.  
""With the territory they have taken the Taliban have inherited responsibilities. The world is watching closely how they are acting, especially towards civilian populations, women, and minorities. The Taliban have gained a certain legitimacy in recent years through their negotiations in Doha, but this legitimacy is premised on their commitment to a political negotiation with the Government of Afghanistan, a commitment which their battle-focused strategy casts into doubt,"" said Lyons. 

""No major donor will finance the repression of women, let me say that again, no major donor will finance the repression of women, nor any major donor will finance the discrimination of minorities, the denying of education to girls, or the decrees of an authoritarian government,"" said Lyons, adding: ""They cannot do so, not only because these are against the norms of the United Nations and international community, but because a society built on these restrictions cannot and will not function for its citizens.""
The UN envoy addressed the other challenges facing Afghanistan:
""Eighteen million Afghans today are facing dire humanitarian needs. That is twice the number of the same category last year. It represents half the country. As we sit in this room today, we must have foremost on our minds these 18 million Afghans, who in the height of a hot summer, endure a fourth wave of COVID (like so many other countries around the world) endure a persistent drought, and intensified fighting that has killed among the highest number Afghans ever —as reported in our recent UNAMA Mid-term review on Protection of Civilians."" 
She also said that: “donors seek reassurance from Afghanistan government that it recognizes the nature of the current crisis and that it has a strategic outlook that addresses it.” 
In the meantime, Afghan President Ghani at the meeting also said: “We believe in the future of Afghanistan,” adding that “today’s Afghanistan has really changed.”  
“I offered a bridge to peace through the holding of early elections,” President Ghani said. “The Loya Jirga took the unprecedented step of releasing 5,000 hardened Taliban fighters and some of the largest drug dealers under the assurance of good conduct by the international community.” 
“Today’s war is not a civil war,” Ghani said, adding that “it’s the war of the networks.”  
“I assure the international community that the people of Afghanistan don’t want anti-government elements,” Ghani said. 
Religious scholars from various countries, including Pakistan, have said that the “current war in Afghanistan is not a religious war,” he added.   
Ghani stated: “There is no military solution to the country’s issue,"" adding that the Afghan government believes in a political settlement. 
“The only solution for the Taliban is a political agreement that satisfies all the people,” he mentioned. 
Referring to the announcement to withdraw foreign troops from Afghanistan by September 11, President Ghani said: “We respect the US President Biden and NATO’s decision on troops withdrawal.” 
“We have never asked President Joe Biden and NATO to change their decision over their troop’s withdrawal from Afghanistan,"" he said, adding that “Afghans should make their future on their own.” 
“The departure of the international forces gives us the opportunity to frame and implement our sovereignty strategies in the manner suited to our unique conditions and history as well as the benefits of regional connectivity and global cooperation,” he added. 
“We have cut the national budget by 5.2% to eliminate waste, prioritize the use of condition-based assistance, ensure delivery of essential services and free resources for our national defense,” he stated. 
He also praised the Afghan security forces for defending their country in the ongoing war.

US 'Really Messed It Up' in Afghanistan: Imran Khan
","
Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan said the US ""really messed it up in Afghanistan"" as he gave his analysis of the US's involvement in Pakistan's neighbor country in an interview with US television network PBS that aired on Tuesday.
“You see, first of all, they tried to look for a military solution in Afghanistan, when there never was one. And people like me who kept saying that there's no military solution, who know the history of Afghanistan, we were called — people like me were called anti-American. I was called Taliban Khan,” he told American PBS TV. 
“For anyone who objected to this way of — I don't know what the objective was in Afghanistan, whether it was to have some nation-building or democracy or liberate the women. Whatever the cause was, the way they went about it was never going to be the solution,” he said. 
“So, when they finally decided that there is no military solution, unfortunately, the bargaining power of the Americans or the NATO forces had gone. When there were 150,000 NATO troops in Afghanistan, that was the time to go for a political solution,” Khan said.
""But once they had reduced the troops to barely 10,000, and then, when they gave an exit date, the Taliban thought they had won. And so, therefore, it was very difficult for now to get them to compromise. It's very difficult to force them into a political solution, because they think that they won,"" he said.
Khan said he believes that the “only good outcome for Afghanistan is that if there is a political settlement which is inclusive, so they form some sort of a government that includes all sorts of different factions there.”
Khan remarked that the worst situation in Afghanistan would be a protracted civil war.
 
“And from Pakistan's point of view, that is the worst-case scenario, because we then — we have — we face two scenarios, one, a refugee problem,” he said. 
""Already, Pakistan is hosting over three million Afghan refugees. And what we fear is that a protracted civil war would be more refugees. And our economic situation is not such that we can have another influx,"" according to Khan. 
“Secondly, the worry is that the civil war will flow into Pakistan, because the Taliban are basically ethnic Pashtuns. Now, there are more Pashtuns on our side of the border than in Afghanistan,” he stated. 
 Asked about the Haqqani Network, Khan said:
""I do not think that ISI controls the Haqqani Network. Yes, they would have connections with them. And if I was the United States, I would use this connection of the ISI with the Haqqani Network to actually get them on the negotiating table.""

ONSC Criticized for Last Year's District Police Appointments
","
The head of the defense affairs committee in Parliament said that one of the reasons for the fall of districts to the Taliban is the unprofessional management and selection of police commanders for the districts.
This comes a day after the head of the Parliament’s internal security commission accused the Office of the National Security Council (ONSC) of incompetence, saying interference by the ONSC in the affairs of the country’s security agencies is complicating the war effort on the battlefield.
Last year the Office of the National Security Council (ONSC) announced the appointment of 100 commanders for the districts.
The ONSC at the time said that the move was to improve the security situation in those districts which were not stable from a security perspective.
But the head of Parliament’s defense commission said that the fall of the districts to the Taliban is related to mismanagement by these police commanders in the districts.
Meanwhile, a number of security analysts said that the appointment of police commanders is the authority of the Ministry of Interior and no other organ including the ONSC has the right to interfere there.
President Ashraf Ghani at the time publically welcomed the appointments made by the ONSC.
“There will be a management system, a motivation, a commitment and a movement and the Afghan nation will remember it with pride in their history,” said Ghani at the time.
“We want you to act with seriousness, we want you to show that when a powerful leader goes to a district, then he is able to change the entire situation,” said Hamdullah Mohib, National Security Adviser.
However, Parliament’s defense commission said that the appointment was full of shortcomings.
“The way they were recruited was not right; if we were looking to bring reforms, we had people in the police ranks to be replaced and the situation could be much better than it is now,” said Mir Haidar Fazli, the head of Parliament’s defense commission.
Dawlat Abad district in Faryab, Jalga and Nahrain districts in Baghlan, Khan Abad district in Kunduz, Jurm and Shaghnan districts in Badakhshan, Darqad district in Takhar, Siah Gard district in Parwan, Ab Band district in Ghazni are among the districts that have fallen to the Taliban. These districts were among the 100 districts for which the ONSC announced new police commanders last year.
“The status of police commanders is clearly written in the law, which is approved through a board by the Ministry of Interior. Regarding this issue, the Office of the National Security Council does not have any authority and it cannot interfere there,” said Mirza Mohammad Yarmand, former deputy minister of interior.
“From a legal perspective, it (ONSC) does not have the authority to do so—they have defined authority in their own way and there is no one above them to ask why,” said Sayed Eshaq Gailani, the head of Nahzat-e-Hambastagi Milli Afghanistan party.
Why did the ONSC make the decision?
“We had high-level security threats during those days in 128 districts, there was a thought at the time to use the police structure too towards tackling the war in the districts,” said Rafi Fazel, the technical deputy of the ONSC.
The criticism comes as the Taliban has taken over 200 districts following the announcement of the withdrawal of US forces.

Taliban Takeover Would Make Afghanistan 'Pariah State': Blinken
","
The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday told reporters in India that Afghanistan would become a “pariah state” if the government commits atrocities against its own population.
""An Afghanistan that does not respect the rights of its people, an Afghanistan that commits atrocities against its own people would become a pariah state,"" Blinken said.
He said that the violence carried out by the Taliban against the Afghan people was deeply troubling and not a good sign for the future of the country. 
""Yes, certainly what we were seeing on the ground in the last week is the Taliban making advances on district centers, challenging some provincial capitals,” Blinken said, adding: “We have also seen these reports of atrocities committed by the Taliban in areas that it has taken over; that are deeply, deeply troubling and certainly do not speak well of the Taliban's intentions for the country as a whole."" 
Blinken, who was in New Delhi for talks with Indian leaders, said the only path to peace in Afghanistan was through negotiations, and that all parties must take them seriously. 
""The Taliban says that it seeks international recognition, that it wants international support for Afghanistan. Presumably it wants its leaders to be able to travel freely in the world, sanctions lifted, etc. Well, the taking over the country by force and abusing the rights of its people is not the path to achieve those objectives,” he said. 
“There's only one path and that's at the negotiating table to resolve the conflict peacefully and to have an Afghanistan emerge that is governed in a genuinely inclusive way and that's representative of all its people,” he further said. 
India’s External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also underlined the importance of the peace negotiations in Afghanistan. 
“The gains to Afghan civil society, especially rights of women, minorities and social freedom –over the last two decades are self-evident,” he said, adding that “Afghanistan must never be home to insurgents, nor become a source of refugees.” 
He also said that it is essential that peace negotiations are taken “seriously by all parties.” 
“The world wishes to see an independent, sovereign, and democratic Afghanistan, at peace with itself and its neighbors,” said Jaishankar.

Fighting between the Afghan security forces and the Taliban reportedly continued in at least 20 provinces across the country in the past 24 hours including Ghazni, Takhar, Kandahar, Helmand and Baghlan provinces.
In the latest incidents of violence, several rounds of rockets hit Maimana city, the center of Faryab province, and PD5 of Lashkargah city has also fallen to the Taliban.
In the western province of Herat, local officials said that the security forces have imposed a nighttime curfew on Herat city to help thwart Taliban threats.
“The Afghan security and defense forces continue with their operations by air and on the ground regularly against Taliban’s positions.

“The people have grave concerns about the Taliban’s mortar attacks on Maimana city, the people want the Taliban to stop these mortar attacks on Maimana city, because the people are killed in these attacks,” said Massoud Adil, a resident in Maimana.
“The people are suffering because of mortar attacks by the Taliban,” said Abdul Qader Joya, a resident in Maimana.

Koofi Calls for Unity at Kabul Ceremony for Attack Victims
","
Marking the second anniversary of the attack on the Green Trend Movement in Kabul, the family members of the 22 people killed in the attack on Wednesday renewed their pledge to defend the present system and the country if the Taliban continue to deny a political settlement to the conflict in Afghanistan.
One of the speakers at the gathering was Fawzia Koofi, a member of the peace negotiating team representing the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in the talks with the Taliban in Doha. Koofi said that the only way toward successful peace talks is with unity among the country’s political elites and the retaking of territories that were lost to the Taliban.
At the same event, the deputy of the Administrative Office of the President said that the Taliban is fighting on behalf of Pakistan and for the sake of Pakistan’s interests.
“The people must get stand alongside their defense and security forces and protect their honor and dignity against the Pakistani militias,” said Abdul Muhiman Fayeq, the head of the Afghanistan Green Trend.
“The present war is a war of values, it is the war of light against darkness,” said Adib Fahim, former deputy head of the NDS.
“They destroy the mosques, they destroy schools and the artists,” said Ahmadullah Nawed, the deputy of the Administrative Office of the President.
“First we need to recapture the geography that we lost,” said Fawzia Koofi, a member of the peace negotiating team representing the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in the talks with the Taliban in Doha.
Two years ago on this day, a powerful car bomb struck the office of Afghanistan Green Trend led by First Vice President Amrullah Saleh killing at least 22 people and wounding dozens more.
The attack happened on July 27, 2019, at the Green Trend’s office as Saleh was meeting with some members of the movement.
 It happened the day before the national presidential election campaign started. It left over 20 people dead and over 50 others wounded.

Justice Ministry Center Offers Legal Aid for Family Law Cases
","
The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) on Wednesday said that it has established a new legal center that will provide the public with free legal advice for cases involving domestic and family issues.
In this report, TOLOnews’ reporter Tamim Hamid interviewed a man who was separated from his wife and children because of a ""small verbal fight."" The man claimed that his wife told his children that their father was dead and then she fled the country.
“I got married to my wife after a period of friendship, however, her family was against our marriage, but we were together for six years, my daughter is 4 years old and my son is two and half years old, but our arguments started, my wife wanted us to migrate abroad, but I was not prepared to sacrifice my family, job and other programs that I had inside Afghanistan,” said Amir.
“There was a small verbal fight, but they portrayed it as a big one because they wanted me to wander from this court to that court,” added Amir.
Sudaba Tajali is one of the legal advisers in the new legal center who intends to support people facing issues such as Amir.
“Those people in remote regions can consult the center, here their problems will be resolved,” said Sudabah.
“A lot of questions are asked here, for instance, someone comes and says 'I got divorced from my husband, I have two children, what will their future be?' said Fazel Azim, an employee of the legal center.
The center began operating three months ago. Visitors can make appointments through a 188 phone number. Five people are currently enrolled in the new center to meet with visitors.
“Our employees are trying to help with the issues by giving legal advice and offering mediation for the people without going to the legal and judicial institutions,” said Aman Riazat, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice.
Since its establishment, the center has helped 80 people with complaints and legal issues.

Russia Increases Tajik Bases Combat Capabilities: Report
","
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Wednesday said they have increased the combat capabilities of its military base in Tajikistan and training local soldiers.
This comes after Moscow warned that Daesh was moving into neighbouring Afghanistan. 
The security situation has rapidly deteriorated in Afghanistan amid a US troop withdrawal, Shoigu said, who was in Tajikistan on Wednesday for talks.
That foreign troops withdrawal has prompted Moscow to prepare for a potentially major security challenge.
Quoted by Reuters, Shoigu said that Daesh fighters are moving into Afghanistan from Syria, Libya and several other countries. 
""What's more, in some parts, we can also see that these movements are quite seriously organised,"" the Russian Defense Minister said.
Calling the US troop exit ""hasty"", Shoigu said that Moscow is training Tajik military personnel at Russian military universities and facilities affiliated with the military base it operates in Tajikistan. 
""We provide everything needed for military training,"" Shoigu said. ""We are paying increased attention to strengthening the combat capabilities of our base and refining plans to jointly repel possible insurgent infiltration.""

This comes as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday said the only path to peace in Afghanistan was through negotiations, which all parties must take seriously. 
A large number of districts have fallen to the Taliban over the last two months after the start of international troops withdrawal from the country.

Describing reports of attacks on civilians as ""deeply, deeply troubling"", Blinken said: ""An Afghanistan that commits atrocities against its own people would become a pariah state. 
""There's only one path, and that's at the negotiating table, to resolve the conflict peacefully,” he said. 
In April, the US President Joe Biden and NATO announced that will withdraw their troops from Afghanistan by September 11. 
Following the announcement, the Taliban has escalated their attacks in deferent parts of the country.

China Criticizes US, NATO for 'Hasty Withdrawal' from Afghanistan
","
China's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday accused the US and NATO of a ""failure"" due to their ""hasty withdrawal"" of troops from Afghanistan, AP reported.
The withdrawal of troops gives the Afghan people ""an important opportunity to stabilise and develop their own country,” Chain Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Zhao Lijian said during a news conference.
The statement comes as China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi met Wednesday with Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and his delegation in the northeastern city of Tianjin as ties between them warm ahead of the US pullout from Afghanistan.
The US withdrawal from Afghanistan by August 31 is seen as a boon to China, Washington's chief strategic competitor, which has long resented the presence of US troops in what it considers its own backyard.
China also hopes the Taliban will ""deal resolutely"" with the East Turkistan Islamic Movement, a group China claims is leading a push for independence in Xinjiang, but which many experts doubt even exists in any operational form, Zhao said.
While no agenda was announced for the meeting, China has an interest in pushing the Taliban to join in peace talks or at least reduce the level of violence as it gobbles up territory from overwhelmed Afghan government forces.
China and Afghanistan share a narrow border high in the remote Wakhan Valley and China has long been concerned about a possible spillover of Islamic militancy into its formerly volatile Xinjiang region.

No Military Solution for Crisis: Ghani
","
President Ashraf Ghani on Thursday, while speaking at a ceremony on National Flag Day at the Presidential Palace, reiterated that “there is no military solution to the country’s crisis.” 
Addressing the Taliban, President Ghani said: ""You will not surrender by force, we will not surrender either, so the solution is to come together.” 
""We will not submit to the devastating plans that foreigners and networks have to turn the country into a battlefield,” he further said, adding: “""Are you committed to the national interests of Afghanistan, or to the networks? Do you want to sow the seeds of hypocrisy and destroy national settlements and foundations?"" 
He stated: “Our voice is the voice of peace, and all Afghans agree on peace, a dignified and lasting peace in which the future of all is secure."" 
He warned that if the Taliban continue the war, then the security forces will respond. 
Ghani said that if Afghanistan becomes insecure than there will be no stability in the region.  
He also mentioned that scholars from the Islamic world, especially at their recent meeting in Saudi Arabia--which was attended by Pakistani religious scholars--stressed that the war in Afghanistan ""has no Islamic legitimacy.” 
He assured the nation that the situation in the country will change soon with the implementation of his security plan. 
On Wednesday, addressing the Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board (JCMB) in a meeting at the Presidential Palace, Deborah Lyons, the UN secretary general's special representative for Afghanistan, said that if there is no progress in the peace talks the world will not work with the Taliban.  
""If there is no movement at the negotiating table, and instead human rights abuses and--worse still--atrocities occur in districts they control, the Taliban will not be seen as a viable partner for the international community,"" said Lyons.   
Lyons said that the meeting takes place in extraordinary circumstances, with work to preserve the gains never more urgent or challenging.   
""With the territory they have taken the Taliban have inherited responsibilities. The world is watching closely how they are acting, especially towards civilian populations, women, and minorities. The Taliban have gained a certain legitimacy in recent years through their negotiations in Doha, but this legitimacy is premised on their commitment to a political negotiation with the Government of Afghanistan, a commitment which their battle-focused strategy casts into doubt,"" said Lyons.  
""No major donor will finance the repression of women, let me say that again, no major donor will finance the repression of women, nor any major donor will finance the discrimination of minorities, the denying of education to girls, or the decrees of an authoritarian government,"" said Lyons, adding: ""They cannot do so, not only because these are against the norms of the United Nations and international community, but because a society built on these restrictions cannot and will not function for its citizens."" 
The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday told reporters in India that Afghanistan would become a “pariah state” if the government commits atrocities against its own population. 
""An Afghanistan that does not respect the rights of its people, an Afghanistan that commits atrocities against its own people would become a pariah state,"" Blinken said. 
He said that the violence carried out by the Taliban against the Afghan people was deeply troubling and not a good sign for the future of the country.  
""Yes, certainly what we were seeing on the ground in the last week is the Taliban making advances on district centers, challenging some provincial capitals,” Blinken said, adding: “We have also seen these reports of atrocities committed by the Taliban in areas that it has taken over; that are deeply, deeply troubling and certainly do not speak well of the Taliban's intentions for the country as a whole.""  
Blinken, who was in New Delhi for talks with Indian leaders, said the only path to peace in Afghanistan was through negotiations, and that all parties must take them seriously.

","
Residents in the newly retaken Kaldar district of Balkh in northern Afghanistan on Thursday shared their experience under the Taliban in the past month, saying the Taliban torched their homes and used residents as human shields during the fighting with the Afghan security forces.
They said the civilian population paid a heavy price during the fighting between the two sides and their livestock and other belongings were lost.
Tazarigh village, which is only 8 kilometers away from center of Kaldar district, saw some of the heaviest fighting between the security forces and the Taliban. People in the area say that their homes were destroyed.
Mohammad Nazar, one of the residents in the village, said: “Here it was our home. The Taliban, who are the slaves of Pakistan, came here and destroyed our homes, they planted mines here,” he said.
Debris can be seen from a distance in Kaldar district.
TOLOnews’ reporter Sayed Mohammad Aref Musvai, reporting from Kaldar, said that the Afghan security forces are still on red alert in the district to respond to possible threats by the Taliban. The security forces liberated Kaldar on Monday.
“The Taliban did not manage to hold out against us, we recaptured the district center in two hours,” said Ahmadullah, a member of the Afghan Special Forces.
Businesses have reopened in the Kaldar district bazaar.

Who Was Khasha Zuwan and Why Was He Killed?
","
The killing of famed comedian Nazar Mohammad, also known as “Khasha Zuwan,” on Tuesday in Dand district of Kandahar by the Taliban has sparked a strong outcry both in Afghanistan and abroad. 
Prominent Afghan political leaders including former President Hamid Karzai have condemned his killing, calling it barbaric and against Islamic values.
The US embassy in Kabul also condemned the killing.
Khasha Zuwan was a famous comedian from Kandahar province. He was 60 years old at the time of his death, and had been involved with comedy for 40 years. His family said that he was not willing to show his comedies on TV, but the people of Kandahar loved him.
“The martyrdom of Khasha, who was bringing smiles to his people in this difficult time of war, indicates an enmity toward art,” said Qasim Wafayeezada, the acting minister of information and culture.
“Khasha Zuwan was a man who was bringing smiles to the face of the people,” said Essa Khan, a resident in Kandahar.
His fans say that despite the fact that he was an illiterate man, he had extraordinary talent.
Khasha’s family told TOLOnews that his dead body was handed over to them at the end of the day after he was arrested in Kandahar by the Taliban.
Video of his arrest on social media shows that he was insulted and beaten by the Taliban.
Cultural figures have decried his murder, calling it a crime against humanity. 
“Slapping Khasha in the face was a slap in the face to the entire Afghan people, it was an insult to human dignity,” said Mohammad Sadiq Sarmastzada, an Afghan artist.
Many of Khasha’s fans reportedly refrained from talking to TOLOnews because they fear threats to their lives. 
Previously the Taliban spokesman told TOLOnews that Khasha Zuwan was a member of the Afghan police and had insulted the Taliban.
The Taliban spokesman said that the group will investigate the way Khasha was murdered.
Khasha’s family has denied he had any links to the police. His family said that Khasha was performing for the security forces to get some money from them.
Khasha left seven children behind.

Officials at the company have said that the company has lost several of its employees in Taliban attacks in the past and has suffered millions of dollars worth of financial losses.
Sources said that in the past three months, Salaam Telecom lost 51 towers. In six districts in Herat all the assets that belong to Salaam Telecom have been destroyed. In 8 other districts, including Torghundi and Islam Qala ports, Salaam Telecom has stopped its activities due to the presence of the Taliban.
“We do not have any operations in areas under the control of the Taliban,” said Ashiqullah Alizai, the head of Salaam Telecom Company in Herat.
“In areas that are under the control of the Taliban--for instance, in Faryab, in one of the districts, as we know, all assets that belonged to Salaam Telecom were looted, however, in other districts, they are operational,” said Enayatullah Kamal, the governor of Faryab.

US Watchdog Says Afghan Govt Faces ‘Existential Crisis’
","
Afghanistan faces an “existential crisis” after a continuing rise in Taliban attacks that began well ahead of the withdrawal of US and coalition troops from the country, a US government watchdog agency said.
The US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconciliation (SIGAR) in a new report released on July 30 said the ANDSF has retaken some districts and the Afghan government still controls all 34 provincial capitals, including Kabul, but from public reporting, the ANDSF appeared surprised and unready and is now on its back foot.
“The overall trend is clearly unfavorable to the Afghan government, which could face an existential crisis if it isn’t addressed and reversed,” said the report.
Afghan forces have faced a surge of attacks since the US-Taliban deal, the report said.
In the 52nd quarterly report to US Congress, SIGAR examines the $144.98 billion US reconstruction effort in Afghanistan.
Citing data from US Forces-Afghanistan (USFOR-A), SIGAR said that enemy-initiated attacks have increased significantly since the signing of the US-Taliban agreement of February 2020.
The report said that from March to May 2021, USFOR-A reported 10,383 Taliban attacks.
According to the figures, ANDSF reporting of Taliban attacks decreased this quarter due to the train, advise, and assist mission ending; the data ended altogether on May 31, 2021.
During the last quarter, the Taliban launched an offensive against the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, overrunning numerous district centers, but continued to avoid attacking US and Coalition forces, the report said. The Taliban also seized a string of key border crossings with the potential to deny the Afghan government significant customs revenue.
In FY 1399, the report said, the border crossings in Herat, Kandahar, and Kunduz Provinces generated 34.3% of the Afghan government's total customs revenues, according to Afghan government accounting data.
Most units of Afghan forces refuse to execute missions without support from the Afghan National Army Special Operations Corps (ANASOC), according to NATO's Special Operations Component Command-Afghanistan, the report said.
All Afghan aircraft have also become strained since the departure of most international troops because of increased requests for close air support, intelligence, reconnaissance missions and aerial resupply, SIGAR said. The aircraft are flying at least 25% over their recommended maintenance intervals, which could have dire consequences, the report added.
SIGAR said the command reported that when ANASOC forces arrive, they are misused to perform tasks intended for conventional forces such as route clearance, checkpoint security, and quick-reaction force.
Five of the seven airframes in the Afghan Air Force experienced decreases in readiness in June alone, according to the report. This coincided with the Taliban offensive and the withdrawal of US and Coalition forces, including aircraft maintenance contractors.
Citing Resolute Support figures, the report said civilian casualties continued to rise this quarter. It adds that the Resolute Support reported 2,035 civilian casualties in April and May 2021, including 705 deaths and 1,330 injuries. This total is nearly as high as the three months from January through March 2021 (2,149 civilian casualties).
Quoting the World Bank report, SIGAR said the Taliban and other anti-government armed groups have escalated their demands on World Bank-funded health services in Afghanistan in recent months. Taliban demands and deteriorating security caused 20% of all health facilities supported by the Bank's Sehatmandi program to close, the report added.
The number of Afghans requiring humanitarian assistance in 2021 has reached approximately half of Afghanistan's total estimated population, SIGAR said, quoting a UN estimation.
The withdrawal of US and Coalition military forces and reductions in other US personnel in Afghanistan complicate the critical task of overseeing US funds still intended for reconstruction programs in that country, the report said. Some $6.7 billion is currently appropriated and awaiting disbursement, with additional billions expected to follow.
The report came after the United Nations said earlier this week that May and June saw the highest number of civilian casualties and injuries in Afghanistan for those two months since systematic documentation began in 2009.

Airlift Begins for Afghans Who Worked for US Govt

“Today is an important milestone as we continue to fulfill our promise to the thousands of Afghan nationals who served shoulder-to-shoulder with American troops and diplomats over the last 20 years in Afghanistan,” Biden said in a statement. 
Biden said that these first Afghans are able to come directly to the United States because they have already completed extensive background checks and security screening by the Intelligence Community and the Departments of State and Homeland Security. 
They will complete the final steps of their visa applications and required medical checks at Fort Lee, in Virginia, before traveling onward to begin their new lives in the United States, the statement said.
“I want to honor all those in the United States who have spoken out on behalf of these brave Afghans, including the proud community of veterans, who have consistently advocated for the Afghans who were by their side in the field in Afghanistan, often serving as translators and interpreters,” Biden said. 
He said that although US troops are leaving, the United States will continue to support Afghanistan through security assistance to Afghan forces, as well as humanitarian and development aid to the Afghan people to help them sustain their achievements of the past 20 years.  
“We will also continue our diplomatic support for the peace process,” Biden said. “We call for an immediate reduction in violence in Afghanistan, and for all regional actors to encourage the parties to return to negotiations without delay so that the Afghan people can achieve a durable and just political settlement that brings the peace and security they deserve.”

He added: “The three million Afghan refugees in Pakistan, almost all of them are Pashtuns and all of them, almost of them, would have sympathies with the Taliban. How is Pakistan supposed to check who is going over there to fight or not when about 25,000 or 30,000 people who cross every day? They are going to Afghanistan and come back.” 
Meanwhile, Chinese Defense Ministry said that the US is responsible for the current situation in Afghanistan and that it cannot put the burden on the shoulder of others in the region. 
“The United States as a responsible party in Afghanistan has an inevitable responsibility for the current situation in the country. The US can’t put the entire burden on the shoulders of other countries in the region,” Wu Qian, the director of the Information Bureau of Ministry of National Defense of China, said. “The US needs to take its responsibility with seriousness in order to have confidence about the situation there and to prevent the possible war after the withdrawal of US forces.” 
Meanwhile, dozens of people at a rally in Kabul accused Pakistan of supporting the Taliban in Afghanistan, something that the neighboring country has denied. 
“Pakistan has committed aggression against our country. ‘Terrorists’ are directly coming from Pakistan and are killing our people,” said Sayed Rahman Zakhelwal, a Kabul resident. 
“Pakistan has committed a lot of atrocities against us,” said Akbar Ali, a Kabul resident. 
 This comes as relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan have soured over the last few weeks. President Ashraf Ghani earlier this month accused Pakistan of supporting the Taliban and said that 10,000 jihadists have flocked from Pakistan recently to fight in Afghanistan.

Flights Canceled at Herat Airport as Clashes Enter 2nd Day
","
 All flights were canceled at the Herat airport on the second day of clashes between government forces and the Taliban near the city of Herat in the west of Afghanistan on Friday, sources said. 
Sources said that Taliban attacked a UN office in Herat and some outposts in the south of the city. Two security guards at the UN office were killed in the attack, sources from Herat said. 
Dozens of families in the south of the city of Herat left their houses as clashes intensified there on Friday. 
“People have left their houses… Taliban and other terrorist groups should realize that today’s Afghanistan is not the one it was 20 years ago,” said Abdul Qayum Rezaee, a Herat resident. 
“Taliban should agree on peace if they are Muslims,” said Wali Mohammad, a Herat resident. 
One of the frontlines was on the two sides of Malan Bridge in the south of the city. 
Najibullah, an army soldier, said he is fighting against the Taliban on the frontline for the last two days. He said Taliban have stationed in people’s houses and that this impedes progress in their operations. 
“Taliban are using people’s houses as a shield. We have not started our operation against the Taliban to avoid harm to civilians,” Najibullah said. 
“We are not making progress to avoid harm to civilians. Taliban are attacking us using people’s houses and mosques,” said Mohammad Ismail, an army officer in Herat. 
The public resistance force led by former mujahedeen leader and Jamiat-e-Islami’s senior member Mohammad Ismail Khan are also fighting against the Taliban in support of the Afghan forces. 
“The enemy had an attack and we pushed their attack by imposing casualties to them. We saw some Taliban bodies and they were Pakistanis,” said Mohammad Amiri, a member of public resistance force. 
“We are defending the country and the honor of the country. Our jihad against the Taliban will continue,” said Sayed Ahmad, a public resistance force member. 
The government and the Taliban claim to have inflicted casualties on each other in Herat clashes, but no details are available in this respect. 
UN on Friday evening confirmed the attack on its office in Herat and condemned it “in the strongest terms possible.”

Current Situation Due to MoD’s Poor Management: Lawmakers
","
Some lawmakers from the defense committees of the two houses of the parliament on Friday said they the poor management in the Ministry of Defense (MoD) in the span of one year under its former leadership is behind the deteriorating security situation in the country during which over 200 districts have fallen to the Taliban. 
The absence of the former defense minister Asadullah Khalid for seven months last year was one of the major issues that led to challenges in the Ministry of Defense and affected battlefields, said Hashem Alokozay, the head of the Senate’s Defense Committee. 
“The entire challenges emancipated from the seven months’ absence of (former) minister of defense during a difficult time. We saw that many districts fell to the Taliban without resistance,” Alokozay said. 
Ali Akbar Jamshidi, member of the Afghan Parliament’s Defense Committee, said that former US commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Scott Miller often opposed the dismissal of Assadullah Khalid as the defense minister. This led to challenges in the Ministry of Defense, he said. 
In Khalid’s absence, Gen. Yasin Zia was appointed as acting minister of defense while he was also the chief of army staff. 
“Interference by them (Americans) in the dismissals and appointments in the army corps including the leadership of the Ministry of Defense was so serious,” Jamshidi said. 
But a spokesman of the Ministry of Defense defended the activities of the security agency, especially when it comes to the management of the war. 
“The army is prepared to defend the country at any front. The progress we see on the battlefields is all because of the efforts made by the security and defense forces, particularly the army,” said Rohullah Ahmadzai, spokesman for Ministry of Defense. 
This comes as Gen. Bismillah Mohammadi was appointed as the acting minister of defense and Gen. Wali Mohammad Ahmadzai as the Afghan army’s chief of staff two months ago.

Taliban Gets Closer to Herat City as Clashes Intensify
","
Clashes intensified for the third day in southern parts of Herat as Taliban advanced to towards the central parts on Saturday, leading to displacement of hundreds of people. 
Security forces said the Taliban is using people’s houses and gardens as a shield, something that officials said has slowed down military operations. 
Out of 17 districts, only Guzara and the city of Herat are under the government’s control. Others are held by the Taliban who are trying to move towards the center of the city. 
Clashes continued for two days in Malan Bridge in south of Herat city, but Taliban took over the area on Saturday, sources said. 
The operation was supported by the Air Force.  
“Pakistani fighters are supporting the Taliban in Herat, Farah and Badghis,” Herat governor Abdul Saboor Qane said. “Taliban has planned to attack Herat but they have faced resistance on the outskirts of the city and were defeated.” 
Former mujahedeen leader and a senior member of Jamiat-e-Islami party is leading hundreds of forces who fight alongside the Afghan troops against the Taliban.  
Khan said President Ghani vowed him on Friday to send reinforcements, but the Ministry of Defense did not pay the required attention in this respect. 
“I spoke with President Ghani yesterday (Friday) and he directed the Defense Ministry to send reinforcements. The forces were supposed to arrive last night, but unfortunately, the Ministry of Defense ‘did negligence’ and so far no reinforcement has arrived here,” Khan said. 
Herat residents who left their homes due to the ongoing clashes in the southern parts of the city, said the violence must stop. 
“Taliban came close to our homes and clashes started. We had no option but to leave our homes,” said Shamil, a Herat resident. 
“Do we deserve to be in such a condition? We left our homes. Some of our neighbors have remained, but they will also leave,” said Nasir Ahmad, a Herat resident. 
On Friday, Colonel Abdul Hamid, Commander of the 1st Regiment of Zafar 207 Corps, was killed in a clash against the Taliban on Friday evening. He led the war in south of Herat. 
The governor of Herat said that Colonel Hamid was first taken as captive by Taliban and then was killed.

MPs: Army Chief Focused on Rivalries, Not War
","
Findings by a parliamentary committee indicate that the newly appointed chief of army staff for Afghanistan, Gen. Wali Ahmadzai, has been focusing on rivalries with corps commanders instead of managing the fight against the Taliban. 
The army general was appointed to the post a month ago, replacing former chief of army staff Gen. Yasin Zia, as the Taliban was taking over as many as a dozen districts each day. He was expected to lead the fight against militants, focus on training and equipping Afghan forces and to implement major military plans. 
The internal security committee of the Wolesi Jirga, the lower house of Parliament, said that Gen. Ahmadzai has fallen short of fulfilling his responsibilities and that during his time he has been focused on rivalries with members of the army corps instead of managing the war.
“We hoped that the appointment of the army chief would lead to some progress, but unfortunately, he is focused on rivalries against those who replaced him in (previous positions). This is not the time for rivalry,” said Khan Agha Rezaee, the head of Parliament’s internal security committee. 
Ahmadzai began his service as an army commander in 1986. In 2015 he was appointed the commander of 215 Maiwand Corps. Three years later he was appointed the commander of 209 Shaheen Corps. He was there for 18 months. Later he was appointed the commander of 215 Atal Corps and then served as the general director of the national public protection force.  
He was the commander of 201 Selab Corps before being appointed the army chief. 
Sources said that Gen. Ahmadzai has not maintained effective relationships with army corps commanders who replaced him in his previous posts. 
After taking charge Ahamdzai vowed to fix the fragile security situation in the country. 
“We accept that the situation has deteriorated,” Ahmadzai said last month. “We lost some territory but we continue discussions about our next plans and programs.” 
A military analyst said that rifts between the army chief and commanders of the army corps will cause the situation to further deteriorate.
“We will face defeat if we don’t have at least common views on the management of the war,” military analyst Jawed Kohistani said. 
The Ministry of Defense, however, denied the findings. 
“The army chief, in line with the prevailing laws of the country and the military principles, is working day and night for the better management of the war. There are no rivalry or rifts against anyone,” said Defense Ministry spokesman Rohullah Ahmadzai.

Taliban’s offensive on the city of Herat was criticized by some lawmakers and analysts as a clear violation of their commitments to the Doha agreement, saying it has displaced hundreds of families and has created panic in the western city. 
Under the US-Taliban agreement signed last year in Doha, the Taliban pledged to avoid attacks on major cities.  
“Taliban had pledged not to attack cities, but they increased their offensive in defiance to their commitments,” said Sadiq Qaderi, an MP. 
“If you (Taliban) have got some bravery, where were you the day when the Punjabis entered into the Afghan territory in Spin Boldak?” Hajj and Religious Affairs Minister Mohammad Qasim Halimi said.  
“Cities have been attacked, districts have been attacked, massive casualties have been inflicted to the people,” said Abdul Wadoud Sabit, a political analyst. 
But Taliban has said that the group has no commitment to not attacking major cities. 
A Taliban negotiator, Shahabuddin Dilawar at a press conference in Moscow this month said the group will have any type of military operation in 34 provinces of Afghanistan, including Kabul.

Critics Speak Out Against Recent, Current MoI Leadership
","
Members of Parliament and a former police chief have raised criticism over what they view as the shortcomings of the leadership of the Ministry of Interior (MoI). They say that for the past year leaders at the ministry have been appointed due to relations rather than merit and that these officials have fallen short in carrying out their responsibilities.
Lawmakers said that Gen. Massoud Andarabi, a former interior minister, and Hayatullah Hayat, a former acting interior minister, as well as the current acting interior minister Gen. Abdul Sattar Mirzakwal, have not succeeded in bringing necessary reforms to the ministry.
They said that corruption in the Ministry of Interior and weak management have also affected police mobilization on the battlefield.
In the last year, the Taliban captured dozens of districts and the management of the war is now facing strong criticism.
Andarabi was appointed as the acting minister of interior in February 2019 and pledged to bring reform and to mobilize the police force--both to enforce the law and to fight on the battlefield. But two lawmakers said that the loss of districts indicated that his plans were not proved effective in reforms as well as for battlefields.
He was removed from his post on March 19, 2021.
“The government leadership has not made the right decision regarding the Ministry of Interior. Wrong decisions are made based on wrong information,” said Abdul Rauf Shpoon, a member of the internal security commission of the Parliament.
Hayatullah Hayat, who served as governor of Helmand, was appointed as the acting minister of interior after Andrabi but was only at the post for three months.
He had no experience in the security or military sector. Analysts said there was no organized plan for police, and so districts fell and the security forces lost strategic areas.
Gen. Abdul Sattar Mirzakwal was appointed to the post on June 19. Some lawmakers said that so far he has not made any tangible progress in bringing reforms to the ministry or in coordinating the police forces fighting against the Taliban in the field.
Mirzakwal said during his first days that going forward the fall of districts would not be acceptable to him.
“It is not acceptable for me that districts are falling. It is not acceptable for me that cities will remain under threat,” Mirzakwal said on June 19. 
However, a former official of the ministry said that a difference between words and actions has affected the efficiency of the police and the interior ministry.
“Unprofessional people, for instance, an engineer, came and was appointed as a minister. A computer specialist came and was appointed as a minister,” said former Khost police chief Daud Amin.
But the Ministry of Interior Affairs stated that efforts are underway to implement reform plans.
“There is maximum coordination between commanders and the frontlines. The leadership of the Interior Ministry practically has a presence on the battlefield,” said Mirwais Stanekzai, spokesman for the Ministry of Interior.

Afghan Army Fuel Sold in Zabul in Major Embezzlement Case
","
Officials at an army corps base in Zabul province in southern Afghanistan illegally sold at least 300,000 liters of Afghan forces' aviation gasoline at local markets, and then created a cover story that the fuel was lost in a rocket attack at their base, said sources. 
Abdul Ghafoor Hotaki, the commander of Zabul garrison, and Sefatullah, the commander of the 2nd regiment of the Afghan Army’s Atal Corps, were allegedly involved in the sale. These two officials sold 300,000 liters of fuel that was kept in storage tanks reserved for the second regiment and was intended for use by the security forces, said sources from security agencies and from Zabul.
Another official allegedly involved in the selling of the fuel is Hekmatullah, the commander of a local forces group led by the NDS that are known as Mofreza forces, sources said.
The fuel was stored in a reserve area that belonged to a private contractor that sold aviation fuel to the army.
“The government’s fuel is sold because these people have become accustomed to embezzlement,” said Abdul Alim Kharoti, a Zabul resident. 
“The government is damaged… that’s why there are many problems in this sector,” said Esmatullah Safi, a Zabul resident. 
When the storage tanks at the 2nd regiment area were empty, those involved in the case detonated three magnetic IEDs to claim the tanks were damaged in a rocket attack and that the fuel was lost due to leaks, sources said. The attempt was made to mislead the newly appointed commander of the regiment. However, photos and video footage from the area show that the fuel tanks were damaged on the bottom, not the top.
“There might be some people who sell or purchase the fuel,” said Taoos Khan, a shopkeeper.
“The fuel is purchased by those who have the ability to buy it, or sell it,” said Mohammad Nabi, a shopkeeper.  
Zabul officials did not comment on the matter. But a government spokesman said the matter will be investigated.
“It is an issue that needs to be investigated. Our first response is that we are not convinced, and we don’t think such an issue exists,” said ANDSF spokesman Omar Shinwari.  
This is not the first time that fuel belonging to the security and defense forces has been sold. Reports also exist of the selling of arms and food belonging to army forces. Some officials have been put on trial for selling military resources.

Ghani: Shift in War Situation Needed for Taliban to Talk Peace
","
The Taliban will show no will for peace and will not get back to the negotiating table unless the situation changes on the battlefield, President Ashraf Ghani said, reiterating that the group has changed compared to 20 years ago, but the change has been negative, and they have become more “cruel.""
Addressing an event at the inauguration of what the Presidential Palace termed ""electronic governance,"" Ghani highlighted the importance of the implementation of his six-month plan and said one part of it includes public mobilization for defending the system under the leadership of the National Directorate of Security.
“A Talib that has changed in the last 24 hours. What is their change? They have become more cruel, more oppressive, more non-Muslim,” Ghani said.
Ghani blamed the Taliban for creating the conditions for the presence of foreign terrorists in Afghanistan and said that based on his plan, the country’s situation will witness a change within the next six months.
“They will not engage in meaningful negotiations unless the situation changes on the battlefield; therefore, we should have a clear stance. For this, there is a need for a countrywide mobilization,” Ghani said.
One of the problems on the battlefield, according to President Ghani, is the delay of payments to security force members. He asked government officials to avoid corruption and don’t make him “ashamed” among Afghanistan’s partners.
He also criticized appointments in government institutions and said some employees in key institutions have been appointed all from one district, calling it against the principles of the Republic.
“There are some provinces in which one district has monopolized all the government seats. The Republic cannot be made with inherited family,” Ghani said.
Meanwhile, the hajj and religious affairs minister, Mohammad Qasim Halimi, said those who are spreading pro-Taliban propaganda and are working in the system should be prevented. He asked the National Directorate of Security to avoid arresting religious scholars without consulting with the Ministry of Hajj and Religious Affairs.
“There are some individuals in society, even government employees, who presume to speak for us, and are making cruel statements,” Halimi said.
Officials called the inauguration of ""e-governance"" a positive step toward expediting the activities of government institutions.

Fighting Continues in Key Areas of Lashkargah for 2nd Day
","
Clashes continued in key parts of Lashkargah city in District 1 near the police headquarters and the provincial governor’s office on Sunday, causing concerns to ratchet up over the situation in the province.
Security sources said many parts of the city have fallen to the Taliban in recent weeks.
Helmand MPs said that the city will be out of the government’s control if it does not receive support. 
“The fighting has reached District 1 and is 100 meters or 200 meters away from the provincial governor’s compound. Fighting is underway to capture the base in the province and the people are concerned,” said Ghulam Wali Afghan, an MP from Helmand.
“Clashes are underway near the Helmand governor’s compound, the police headquarters and the NDS office. They will fall if attention is not paid to them,” said Karim Atal, an MP from Helmand.
But ANDSF spokesman Gen. Omar Shinwari said strong defensive lines have been established in Helmand, Herat and Kandahar and that there are no serious problems in the cities of these provinces.
TOLOnews findings show that 70 districts, as well as the Spin Boldak border town, fell to the Taliban in July. The government said that 11 districts had been retaken from the Taliban in July, but five of them--Yaftal in Badakhshan, Chakhansur in Nimroz, Malistan in Ghazni, Garmsir in Helmand and Guzara in Herat--have once again fallen to the Taliban.
“We will witness a worse situation if reforms are not brought to the leadership of military units,” said Mehrabuddin Safi, a military affairs analyst.
Insecurity has also affected Kabul. In a recent incident, unknown gunmen attacked a police vehicle in the Company area west of Kabul, killing a police officer and two civilians and wounding three more. 
“No one pays attention to security. We demand safety,” said Sayed Faqir, an eyewitness of the incident. 
“What is the sin of the ordinary people?” said Rafi, an eyewitness.
TOLOnews findings show that for just the month of July, 313 civilians and 239 security force members were wounded in security incidents and Taliban attacks. The figures show that 700 civilians and 216 security force members were wounded during this period.
The government said that the Taliban has sustained heavy casualties during this time.

Lawmakers Unanimously Support ANDSF in Joint Statement
","
As clashes have intensified around the country, especially in major cities, the National Assembly – the upper and lower house of Parliament – in a joint statement Monday announced their firm support for the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) and the Islamic Republic and said the hard-won gains of the last 20 years must be preserved.
The lawmakers said they also support the protection of women’s rights and seek financial and political support from the US and the UN.
“The National Assembly as the highest legislative institution supports the principle of the republic and will not allow the achievements of the last two decades to vanish,” the statement reads.
The lawmakers said that the Afghan forces are sacrificing their lives every day to fight “the enemy;” therefore, they have full support from the National Assembly.
“The country has been at war for 43 years and we are seeking lasting stability and will fulfil our responsibility in this respect,” the statement said.
The statement called on the Taliban to stop its activities against the economy and stop “destruction.”
This comes as the Taliban has captured a large number of districts as well as seven border towns, cutting off imports and exports in many of them.
The Afghan government has lost 2.7 billion Afs (over $33 million) in customs revenue over the last four weeks as key border towns have fallen to the Taliban during this period, an official from the Ministry of Finance said last week. 
Over the past month, the government has lost control of key border towns including Islam Qala in Herat, Abu Nasr Farahi in Farah, Spin Boldak in Kandahar, Ai Khanum in Takhar, Dand Patan in Paktia and Shirkhan in Kunduz province. 
President Ghani spoke at the special meeting of the National Assembly and blamed the Taliban for becoming more violent than in the past.

Ghani: Unity Needed as Afghans Face 'Great Test'
","
President Ashraf Ghani addressed a joint special session of the National Assembly on Monday to speak on the current situation in the country, saying “we have paid a high price for peace” but still the nation faces war. 
“We have paid a high price for peace and showed great gentleness, but instead war was imposed on us,” President Ghani said, indirectly referring to the release of the 5,000 Taliban prisoners by the Afghan government earlier in the peace process.
Ghani said an ""imported"" and ""hasty"" process was imposed on Afghanistan which resulted in ""legitimizing an insurgent group instead of achieving peace."" 
“The Taliban has changed only in that their cruelty has increased,” he said.
“We no longer have the ... opportunity of blaming each other, we all face a great test,” he said. 
Ghani stated that “the current situation is due to a sudden decision on the withdrawal of the international troops,” but “the protection of the people is our duty.” 
He mentioned that the nation was faced with an unexpected situation in the past three months.  
“This aggression and war has been imposed on us,” he said.  
He urged the Afghan national assembly and the political leaders to seek unity, saying it is the ""only way toward our victory."" 
“We must go toward national mobilization, and we must all work for the national mobilization,” he said. 
Speaking of the government forces, President Ghani said he believes that the forces have increased their level of mobilization and will continue to do so.
He said the Taliban is ""not committed to any values.""
He assured the nation that the situation will change in the upcoming six months due to the security plan that the Afghan government has prepared. 
“The army is defending strategic goals and the police are defending the cities,” he said.

Uzbek, Tajik Militaries Conduct Drills Close to Afghan Territory
","
Uzbek military forces crossed the Tajik border on Monday, to take part in joint Russian-Tajik-Uzbek drills close to the territory of Afghanistan, Reuters reported. 
The military exercises are to take place from August 5 to August 10 according to Uzbekistan's Ministry of Defense. 
Moscow said it would send a much bigger military contingent to Tajikistan for trilateral exercises amid fears in both countries over a worsening security situation in Afghanistan that could spill over into Central Asia. 
Security has rapidly deteriorated in Afghanistan amid the US troop withdrawal. Moscow fears that could destabilize its southern defensive flank and push refugees into its Central Asian backyard. 
On Monday, Russia's defense ministry said that 1,800 of its soldiers would take part in the Tajik drills, instead of 1,000 as initially planned. More than 2,500 troops would be involved in total, it said. 
Moscow will also use 420 units of military hardware for the drills, double the quantity originally planned, it said.

US Announces New Refugee Program for Afghans
","
The US State Department on Monday announced a new refugee program for Afghans called the Priority 2 (P-2) designation, which grants the ""US Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) access for certain Afghan nationals and their eligible family members,"" according to an official statement. 
""The US objective remains a peaceful, secure Afghanistan. However, in light of increased levels of Taliban violence, the US government is working to provide certain Afghans, including those who worked with the United States, the opportunity for refugee resettlement to the United States,"" the US State Department said.
The US has seen a major influx of Special Immigrant Visa requests amid the US military withdrawal that is scheduled to be completed by September 11, 2021. The official statement acknowledged that this new immigration provision is intended to open up opportunities for those Afghans and their families at risk:
""This designation expands the opportunity to permanently resettle in the United States to many thousands of Afghans and their immediate family members who may be at risk due to their US affiliation but who are not eligible for a Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) because they did not have qualifying employment, or because they have not met the time-in-service requirement to become eligible."" 
Below are the specific US State Department terms:
Individuals Eligible for the P-2 Program: 
Afghans who do not meet the minimum time-in-service for a SIV but who work or worked as employees of contractors, locally-employed staff, interpreters/translators for the US Government, United States Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A), International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), or Resolute Support; 
Afghans who work or worked for a US government-funded program or project in Afghanistan supported through a US government grant or cooperative agreement; 
Afghans who are or were employed in Afghanistan by a US-based media organization or non-governmental organization. 
Afghans and their eligible family members (spouse and children of any age, whether married or unmarried) can be referred to the P-2 program by a US government agency.  For non-governmental organizations (NGO) and media organizations that were not funded by the US government, but are headquartered in the United States, the senior-most US citizen employee of that organization may make a referral. 
P-2 Program for Afghan Nationals:  
The Department of State has designated certain categories of Afghan nationals as having access to the USRAP by virtue of their circumstances and apparent need for resettlement. 
To manage the P-2 program for Afghan nationals, the State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) created a USRAP Afghan Referrals Workgroup comprised of federal agencies to refer individuals directly to the USRAP. 
If an individual is not eligible for the P-2 program, he or she may be eligible for the Priority 1 (P-1) program by virtue of their circumstances and apparent need for resettlement.  Individuals may be referred to the P-1 program by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), a US Embassy, or a designated NGO.

Fighting in Helmand's Capital Lashkargah Continues for 5th Day
","
Clashes between government forces and the Taliban intensified in the city of Lashkargah in southern Helmand province, leaving some streets of the city empty of residents and adding to concerns about rising threats to major capitals.
The frontline was in District 1 where the US conducted an airstrike on Monday morning that left seven Taliban killed, according to the Defense Ministry.
Lawmakers from Helmand said that the prison and the police headquarters are under siege and that clashes in District 1 are focused on capturing the district governor’s compound.
Nine bodies and eight wounded were taken to the Emergency Hospital in Lashkargah on Monday, officials said.
“Fighting is underway in Lashkargah. The security forces are not in a good condition there,” said Mohammad Jami, a civil society activist from Helmand.
“Recently people’s homes were bombarded. The Taliban is hiding in people’s houses and using them as shields,” said Akhtar Mohammad Badi Zai, a civil society activist from Helmand.
The Taliban has taken over 12 districts in Helmand except for Kajaki district and has captured nine out of 10 districts in the city of Lashkargah, security sources said.
Sources said all media broadcasts halted in Helmand as clashes intensified in Lashkargah.
The national TV office in Helmand in Lashkargah's District 1 was taken over by the Taliban on Monday morning, sources said, who also said that employees of the media outlet have not been in the office for the last two days.
Sources said that Matiullah Popal, the acting police chief for Nawzad district in Helmand, was killed while fighting the Taliban in the city of Lashkargah on Monday morning.
“We will soon witness the fall of Lashkargah if the situation continues,” said Shogufa Nawrozi, an MP from Helmand.
The Defense Ministry said the Taliban has sustained heavy casualties in the Helmand clashes.
“Firmly support the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces as well as the Republic. Besides this, make efforts for mobilizing the people,” President Ghani told lawmakers at a special session on Monday.
Also on Monday, five security force members were also killed in a Taliban attack on their outposts in the west of Charikar City in the central province of Parwan.

Clashes entered the sixth day in the city of Herat on Monday specifically in districts 2, 3, 7 and 14 as well as in the southern parts of Herat’s capital near Injil district.
Herat is the second provincial capital city along with Lashkargah where heavy clashes have been underway for the past few days.
“We have air support and the Taliban’s gatherings have been targeted in various parts of Herat city where they have sustained heavy casualties,” said Herat governor Gen. Abdul Saboor Qani.
A former mujahedeen leader and senior member of the Jamiat-e-Islami party, Mohammad Ismail Khan, who is leading public uprising forces in the fight against the Taliban, asked Heratis to mobilize against the Taliban and assured them that the city will be defended.
“It is an obligation to all men and women in Herat to save themselves from this force of ignorance,” Khan said. “The Taliban has found more arrogance than in the past.”
Some young men who recently joined the public uprising forces said they will not allow the Taliban to take over the city.
“Our homeland will be destroyed if we leave it to the Taliban,” said Mohammad, a public uprising forces member. “We will not allow the Taliban to capture our country. They will be defeated.”
“The imam of our mosque has joined the Taliban and is fighting against us,” said Shahryar, a public uprising forces member.

Justice Minister Accuses Taliban of War Crimes
","
Justice Minister Fazel Ahmad Manawi on Monday said the Taliban is guilty of war crimes for torturing and killing war hostages. He said the group is not committed to adhering to any international laws or humanitarian norms. 
Manawi said that all crimes against humanity committed by the Taliban should be assessed at the national and international levels.
A video circulating on social media shows Taliban militants killing an army commander after he is arrested by the group.
Specifically, the video shows the moment when Colonel Abdul Hamid Hamidi, the commander of the 1st Regiment of the Afghan Army’s 207 Zafar Corps in Herat, is taken captive. Security officials said the colonel was arrested with five of his soldiers and then he was shot and killed.
“What is done by the Taliban is a violation of human rights, a violation of international law and is an international crime and humanitarian crime,” Manawi said.
A watchdog organization said that it has registered many such incidents of war crimes committed by the Taliban.
“Shooting captives is against the law and is a crime under national and international laws as well as under Sharia law,” said Mohammad Ayub Yusufzai, a member of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission.
The Taliban did not comment on the matter.
Another video that has been confirmed by a Taliban spokesman shows two people killed after a guilty verdict by a kangaroo court for charges of robbery.
“They want to cause horror among the people to the extent that people are afraid of them,” said Injila Rahil, the deputy chairperson of the lawyers' union.
President Ashraf Ghani, who attended a special session of the houses of Parliament on Monday said the Taliban has become crueler compared to the past.
“Talib attacks are more violent, more bloodthirsty and more oppressive,” Ghani said.
Back in June, 23 members of an Afghan special force unit were executed by the Taliban in Faryab province after they surrendered to the group. Moreover, a famous comedian, Mohammad Khasha Zwan, was killed in Kandahar after he was taken captive by the group late last month.

EU Special Envoy Sees ‘No Change’ in Taliban
","
The EU special envoy for Afghanistan Tomas Niklasson said he sees no clear indication of a fundamental change in the Taliban based on considering what they say compared to what they do in the peace process and efforts for a political settlement to end the conflict in the country.
Talking to TOLOnews, Niklasson said that taking power by force will lead to international isolation and the establishment of a so-called Islamic emirate will lead to isolation.
He said that the choice for the Taliban now is either to negotiate, to find a settlement, or decide if they want an isolated Afghanistan, as in the past.
He added that this choice must be made clear.
The EU special envoy said that the Taliban at least formally committed to returning to the negotiating table and said they are not interested in taking Kabul by force, but they should put these two together and return to the talks in a meaningful way.
For the moment, the Taliban largely want to pursue a military campaign, whether that is to take power by force or strengthen their negotiating position.
“I think they are honest and earnest, they want peace, but they may well want peace from a position of strength and they may want peace on their conditions and as long as they still see the possibility which I think isn’t there but as long as they think there is a possibility of taking power by force, or as long as they think that they can still strengthen their negotiating position further by advancing, they will continue to do so,” he said.
He said that Taliban will pay more attention to the final result rather than to the means.
He said that there is “no clear indication” that the Taliban has fundamentally changed.
“I have to base it on what I see and what I hear,” he said in response to a question whether the Taliban has changed. “I hear commitments to change but I must also look at very seriously the behavior we see in districts taken by the Taliban in recent weeks and months where we see repeated, frequent and widespread violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights to which Afghanistan has signed up. We see girls being prevented from going to schools, we see hands being cut off as a former punishment after rudimentary judicial processes if any, we see looting of civilian property, we see destruction of public property.”
“This is something I have to take into account when I try to form my own opinion on whether they have changed,” he said. “I haven’t seen anything put on the table that explains a different outlook on what Afghanistan under Taliban rule would look like on which I could form a different opinion.”
The EU special envoy said that public uprising forces are an understandable phenomenon and he hopes they play a positive role. But he added that it is accompanied by some risks.
He said that Pakistan should make a choice about whether it wants a stable Afghanistan or an isolated Afghanistan that is governed by a regime over which Pakistan believes it has some influence.

Taliban ‘Will Be Defeated’ If No Political Settlement: Karzai
","
In an interview with Russian media, former president Hamid Karzai said the Taliban “will be defeated” by Afghans and the people will confront them and will form an uprising against them if the group continues its violence.
“If the Taliban continue to oppose that--this would be confronted but I want this confrontation to be political, not military,” Karzai said in an interview with Russia’s RTA. “They must agree to that or they will be defeated. The Afghan people will rise against them.”
Karzai said the Afghan people are giving the Taliban an opportunity.
“This means an opportunity to coexist and to allow the country to progress. If they don’t allow that and if they continue to seek their own domination of Afghanistan the way they think of it, that will give rise to a national uprising without a doubt and I will be one of those people,” Karzai said.
He added that the current situation is challenging but he hopes that the country will move toward improvement.
When asked about the best- and worst-case scenarios for Afghanistan within the next one or two years, Karzai said he doesn’t see the worst-case scenario for Afghanistan.
“I have the best-case scenario for Afghanistan. I am seeing some trends towards that. Yes, we are, at the moment, in a very, very difficult spot. There’s immense violence in Afghanistan. There’s immense anger in our country, but I also see the Afghans are waking up to the new reality and those who want to want to, opt to stay in Afghanistan, will make it better,” he added.
This comes as US State Department spokesman Ned Price on Monday said that the Taliban is responsible for “outrageous and atrocious acts of violence.”
“Well, there’s one party that is in most cases, responsible for the outrageous and atrocious acts of violence that have been perpetrated against the Afghan people, and that’s the Taliban, of course, other terrorist groups, ISIS also active, but we have seen an increase in these ongoing Taliban attacks. They show little regard for human life, for the rights of the Afghan people, including the basic right of the Afghan people to live in safety and security,” he said.
He added that “the targeted killings, the destruction of buildings and bridges, other vital infrastructure, other violent acts against the people of Afghanistan, we recognize they are in stark contravention to statements from the Taliban leadership.”

Gen. Sadat said he made the announcement because the safety of residents is the priority of the ANDSF. 
The clashes in Lashkargah, capital of the southern province of Helmand, have entered their sixth day.
  
On Tuesday morning residents of Lashkargah said that heavy fighting that had begun the night before was still ongoing close to the police HQ, the provincial governor's compound, the NDS office and the prison in PD1 of Lashkargah.

“The shops are on fire. Civilian casualties are high, and airstrikes are ongoing,” said Jawid Ahmad, a resident of Lashkargah who fled the city for Kabul on Tuesday. 
Social media footage also shows bodies out in the open in different parts the city.  
On Monday the coordinator of the MSF Helmand project Sarah Leahy said: “There has been relentless gunfire, air strikes and mortars in densely populated areas. Houses are being bombed, and many people are suffering severe injuries.” 
“Fighting within the city makes it harder for us to respond; our staff are part of the community and they, like many people, are afraid to leave their homes. It’s just far too dangerous and life is at a standstill,” says Leahy.  
“Some of our colleagues are staying overnight in the hospital as it’s safer, but also so they can keep on treating patients. The situation has been dire for months but now it is even worse,” Leahy added.

Afghan Citizens Blast Politicians For Not Defending Country

As fighting rages in various provinces, citizens criticized key Afghan politicians, asking the whereabouts of those influential political and jihadi figures who claimed to be leading major ethnic groups in the country but who are not defending the people and provinces from Taliban attacks.
The war has intensified in Kandahar, Badakhshan, Ghazni, and Faryab provinces, and residents ask: What are the key politicians and jihadi leaders like Salahuddin Rabani, Mohammad Mohaqeq, Karim Khalili, Abdul Rashid Dostum, Hamid Karzai, and Attah Mohammad Noor Helmand doing to fight the Taliban?
Several citizens and MPs say that key politicians have only supported the government for their own benefits and are now hiding in their homes in Kabul, or they have kept silent while they are out of the country.
“They should be ashamed. If I was in their place, instead of these politicians, I would repent. If you ask people about them, they are not happy,” said Ferdaws, a resident of Kabul.
Another Kabul resident Lal Mohammad said: “They are only fighting for power; they don’t think about people. They ruin people.”
Many Afghan citizens have blamed Afghan politicians for not taking part in the defense of the country and have not commented on the public criticism; however, previously they spoke of supporting the Afghan government and defending it from Taliban attacks if the peace process failed.
“They always act based on their own benefit; they neither have assets here nor are their families living in the country,” MP Khalid Asad said.
“The government should work on such an approach so that politicians could defend their country alongside security forces,” MP Abdaal Allah Mohammadi said.
Meanwhile, the Taliban have taken over parts of Kandahar, including Spin Boldak district, while Tadin Khan, a popular commander in the province is currently in Kabul. He is also a member of the leadership committee of the High Reconciliation Council.
A source close to Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum said that he is currently in Uzbekistan and is planning to travel to Kabul in the upcoming week. The source added that Dostum will go to the north of the country after having a meeting with President Ghani.
Among famous politicians in the country, only Amir Ismail Khan, a former jihadi commander, has taken up arms against the Taliban and is leading the people's mobilization in Herat. Herat residents say he has saved the city from collapse.
Although the Taliban launched a large-scale offensive in Herat over the past week, the mobilization of the people, led by Amir Ismail Khan, has helped government forces to halt the Taliban from taking over the city, sources say.

Kapisa: Afghan Forces Clear Villages in Retaken District
","
Afghan forces began a village-to-village clearance operation in Nijrab district in Kapisa province after it was retaken from the Taliban on Monday.
Provincial council members from the district said the district fell to the Taliban due to lack of coordination among the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces and the public uprising forces. They warned that such a situation should not happen again.
“The Taliban always creates terror, disturbs people and targets people’s houses with rockets,” said Moinuddin Siyal, police chief of Kapisa.
“The recent operation was effective and suppressed the enemy. The district was cleared of the enemy and now the security and defense forces have a full presence there,” said Rohullah Ahmadzai, spokesman for Defense Ministry.
The reasons for the fall of Nijrab district to the Taliban, which occurred in the first week of July, have been discussed by residents and lawmakers. 
A member of Parliament from Kapisa, Mir Haidar Afzali, said there is a need to boost coordination between the local forces and the security forces in the district.
“When districts are retaken, we have the challenge of keeping them. I hope we don’t face problems like in Nijrab,” Afzali said.
Some sources said that Kamdish district in Nuristan has fallen to the Taliban, but the Defense Ministry said that the district is still under the control of Afghan forces.
“If Kamdish falls, all Nuristan will fall,” said Qamar Bano, an MP from Nuristan.
“I think that our future will be bleak if the situation continues,” said Faqir Mohammad Faqir, a former interior minister who served during Hafizullah Amin’s government.
The Defense Ministry said that at least 375 Taliban fighters were killed in Afghan forces operations in the last 24 hours. The Taliban has denied the claim.

Atmar Calls For Increased Pressure by Intl Community on Taliban
","
Foreign Minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar on Tuesday said that Qatar will host two key meetings on Afghanistan in the coming days but added that there is a need for more action by the international community beyond merely issuing statements from these events. 
Atmar said that two important meetings will be held in Qatar in the coming days: one with regional and international allies and an Extended Troika session. 
“In these two meetings, the firmness of the region and the international community through political means should be explained to the Taliban so they know that they are not only facing the people and the government of Afghanistan but also they are also facing a united stance of the region and the international community, and they must end violence,” Atmar said at a news conference.
Atmar said that two meetings were hosted by Kabul with representatives of over 20 countries from the region and representatives of 15 other countries and organizations to discuss the challenging security situation in Afghanistan, the political situation, the violation of human rights “by the Taliban” and the Afghan government’s security plan. 
Atmar said that they told the representatives that the Taliban is supported by “foreign terrorists” and that the group is focusing their attacks on cities rather than focusing on peace efforts.  
He said that the Afghan government at the session asked the international community to put pressure on the Taliban to respect human rights and return to meaningful negotiations. 
“Our focus was on the International Criminal Court, the International Human Rights Organization, the council of human rights, and the High Commissioner of the UN for Human Rights,” Atmar said, referring to his meetings with the representatives. 
Atmar added that the Qatar negotiations must succeed as they have the full support of Afghans and the international community.  
He stated that the Qatar negotiations have one hurdle: the Taliban's insistence on totalitarianism and their focus on fighting. 
This comes as heavy fighting has continued in two major cities, Lashkargah and Herat, for the last week, leaving many people displaced and dozens killed in both provinces.

Afghanistan: 51 Media Outlets Closed Amid Fighting
","
The Ministry of Information and Culture on Tuesday said that 51 media outlets have been closed in the country due to an increase in violence over the last three months. 
The ministry said that 16 of the media outlets, including four TV networks, are in Helmand and stopped operating in recent weeks. 
“So far, 35 media outlets have stopped their operations, over 6 media outlets have fallen to the Taliban and are being used as a voice for their activities,” said acting Minister of Information and Culture Qasim Wafaeezada. 
Data by Nai, an organization supporting open media in Afghanistan, shows that 51 media outlets have been closed across the country since April. 
The outlets were operating in Helmand, Kandahar, Badakhshan, Takhar, Baghlan, Samangan, Balkh, Sar-e-Pul, Jawzjan, Faryab, Nuristan and Badghis. 
Five TV networks and 44 radio stations, one media center and a news agency are among the outlets that halted their operations. 
In this period, over 1,000 reporters and media workers, including 150 women, lost their jobs.  
Two journalists have lost their lives in the last two months.  
Mina Khairi, a news anchor at Ariana News, was killed in an explosion in Kabul on June 3. Danish Siddique of Reuters was killed in a Taliban ambush on the way to Spin Boldak district in Kandahar. 
One of the TV networks that stopped operations in Helmand is the national radio and TV network, and its Lashkargah office in District 1 has fallen to the Taliban.
“Our demand is that the media buildings not be damaged. They should not be used as a stronghold,” said Hayatullah Dawari, head of the national TV in Helmand. 
Maryam Durani, the owner of Mirman Radio in Kandahar, said that they have had to restrict their operations due to the rise in threats in the province.
Durani said that three of her colleagues have left their jobs, but she said that nothing will stop them from continuing to put out the news. 
“Considering what is said overall, it is difficult to decide whether to keep female workers or not,” she said. 
Some media-supporting organizations said they are concerned about the fall of some media outlets to the Taliban, adding that five radio stations have started pro-Taliban broadcasts in areas under their influence in Baghlan, Faryab, Badakhshan and Samangan provinces. 
“Access to information, which is a right of the people, is taken from them and freedom of speech is taken from them,” said Mujib Khalwatgar, head of Nai, an organization supporting open media in Afghanistan. 
Officials from Dehraood Radio in Uruzgan claimed that the Taliban “looted” all the equipment in the radio station after the militants captured Dehraood district two weeks ago. They also claimed that the Taliban destroyed the antenna of the station. The Taliban has not commented on the allegation.  
But Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that the media outlets have been closed due to the ongoing clashes; therefore, the group cannot ask them to resume their activities.
Government figures show that there are 248 TV networks, 438 radio stations, 1,669 print media and 119 news agencies in the country.

Defense Minister Mohammadi, in response to the attack, said that such attacks by the Taliban will not demoralize Afghan forces in their defense of the nation.
“You cannot easily cross this road if there is a small pack with you,” said Abdul Qasim Rahimi, a resident in Kabul. (meaning?)
A TOLOnews reporter who visited the blast scene said that the explosive device was planted near a security tower which is under the control of NDS forces. Two NDS officers, two children and an elderly man are among the wounded.

7 People Killed in Criminal Incidents in Kabul in 3 Days: Report
","
Amid concerns over growing security threats in Kabul, a TOLOnews report revealed that at least seven people have been killed in the city as a result of criminal activity over the past three days.
Residents in Kabul criticized the government's security strategy for the national capital and said that serious crimes such as armed robbery have increased.
However, the office of First Vice President Amrullah Saleh said that the security situation has improved in Kabul.
Kabul has approximately 6 million inhabitants.
“I was going home from the shop and they took my money and phone,” said Ahmad Shekib, a resident in Kabul, referring to armed robberies.
“The robber hit me in my stomach,” said Ahmad Fawad, a resident in Kabul.
“We do not want anything, we want security, we want to go home in a secure way,” said Nangyalai, a resident in Kabul.
“Amrullah Saleh was helpful initially, but when he reached a position of power, then he did nothing,” said Ahmad Zia Noori, a father in Kabul who son was killed as a victim of criminal activity.
Last year Amrullah Saleh, in the midst of a crime wave in Kabul, personally took charge of the security situation in the city and launched a new security initiative called the""6:30 meeting."" The meeting is convened every morning to assess the overall security situation in the city.
“Only a minister is able to report to the First Vice President, so there was no need felt by police chiefs and the head of the NDS for Kabul to be there, so we witnessed the outcome,” said military analyst Tahir Yarghal.
“The 6:30 meeting has managed to bring fundamental changes when it comes to combating terror activities and other criminal cases in Kabul,” said Zia Warsaji, a member of the media department of Saleh’s office.
“Ashraf Ghani and the Security Council are not willing to share the political power and security structures of Afghanistan independently with those people and with those who have a management capacity,” said military analyst Jawed Kohistani.
While the Presidential Palace claims to have appointed the most professional people to positions in the security organizations, members of Parliament have described the appointments as unprofessional.
“If the president does not break the circle that exists in the Arg (Presidential Palace), then the president will escape, Dr. Abdullah will escape, the war leaders will escape, then it will be the Afghan people who will fight the Taliban and Pakistan,” said MP Abdul Rauf Eshpon.

Taliban Killed 'Possibly 800-900 People' in Kandahar: Tadin Khan
","
The former police chief of Kandahar and a member of the High Council of the National Reconciliation (HCNR), Tadin Khan, on Wednesday stated that the Taliban ""does not believe in human rights,"" saying the group has killed potentially up to 900 people in Kandahar province in the past month and a half. 
Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a statement saying that Taliban forces that are advancing in Ghazni, Kandahar, and other Afghan provinces have summarily executed detained soldiers, police, and civilians with alleged ties to the Afghan government.
“Summarily executing anyone in custody, whether a civilian or combatant, is a serious violation of the Geneva Conventions and a war crime,” said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director. “Taliban commanders with oversight over such atrocities are also responsible for war crimes.”
The Taliban denied the allegations.
According to Tadin Khan, the Taliban forcefully took these 900 people from their homes and killed them. 
“They possibly martyred 800 to 900 people in the past month and a half. The people have suffered enormously. The brutality that occurred in Boldak (Spin Boldak district of Kandahar) is unforgivable,” said Tadin Khan.
The HRW statement also said: “Human Rights Watch obtained a list of 44 men from Spin Boldak, Kandahar, whom the Taliban have allegedly killed since July 16. All had registered with the Taliban before being summarily executed. Waheedullah, a police commander from Spin Boldak, had obtained a 'forgiveness' letter from the Taliban, but Taliban fighters took him from his house and executed him on August 2, activists and media monitoring these detentions in Kandahar said."" 
“The civilians who have worked with the government should not be targeted, it is a war crime and a violation of human rights,” said Shahrzad Akbar, the head of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC).
According to the HRW report, the Taliban after taking over the center of Malistan district in Ghazni province began searching house to house ""apparently to identify residents who had worked for the provincial or district government or security forces."" The Taliban ""took into custody dozens of residents, some of whom were later released after being compelled to provide assurances they would not cooperate with the government,"" said Human Rights Watch, adding that the organization ""could not confirm the status or whereabouts of those not released.""

Alizai said the Taliban’s designated governor for Helmand was killed in the fight with security forces, but the Taliban denied this claim. 
“The Taliban has suffered heavy casualties in the Helmand clashes,” he said. 
Thursday marks the ninth day of fighting in Lashkargah.
Airstrikes in several parts of Lashkargah were carried out on Wednesday night, according to security forces.  
There have been no numbers available since Wednesday night of casualties sustained by government forces or of civilians.
Out of 10 districts in Lashkargah, nine have been captured by the Taliban in the recent fighting.
12 of the 13 districts in Helmand are controlled by the Taliban. Only Kajaki district remains under government control. 
On Wednesday, fighting continued near the police HQ, governor's office, the prison, the National Directorate of Security (NDS) and other government buildings in PD1 of the city, according to the local officials. 
All key government offices are in PD1. 
Previously, the residents of Helmand said that houses, shops, and markets have sustained heavy damage during the ongoing clashes. 
Thousands of families have been displaced. 
On Tuesday, the commander of the Army's 215 Maiwand Corps, Gen. Sami Sadat, urged Lashkargah residents to evacuate their houses as the ANDSF is planning large-scale operations to clear the city of Taliban.   
Gen. Sadat said he made the announcement because the safety of residents is the priority of the ANDSF.

Dostum also paid tribute to the sacrifices made by the Afghan National Security and Defense Forces (ANDSF).
“The people want commitment from us, and we have given our commitment to the people--we will deliver on our commitments and will not leave the people alone. Today we are here to defend and to prove to history that we do not deceive the people,” said Dostum.

Cries of 'Allahu Akbar' in Support of ANDSF Spread Across Nation
","
Like millions of people across Kabul, Afghans in other provinces on Wednesday night chanted the slogan ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is the greatest), in a show of support for Afghan forces fighting the Taliban.
The rallying cry began earlier in Herat city and has been reported in other areas across the nation as well.
In the latest waves of support, Afghans in Kapisa, Baghlan, Nuristan and Sar-e-Pul provinces chanted the slogan to show support for the Afghan forces. 
A number of religious scholars said that chanting the slogan ""Allahu Akbar"" is very important to separate the evil from the truth and that the slogan will help boost the morale of the ANDSF in their campaign against the militants.
“The people of Balkhab are always ready, they will act against all aggressors including the Taliban,” said a resident in Sar-e-Pul province.
“We will defend the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Constitution,” said a resident in Samangan.
“It indicates that the people support ANDSDF and they are tired of the war, this is totally a people's movement,” said Fawad Raiskhel, a resident in Kabul.
“The people, by chanting the slogan of 'Allahu Akbar,' want to show that they are tired of the war and they support their security forces,” said Idris Feda, a resident in Kabul.
“It has a great impact on morale, those who are chanting the slogan 'Allahu Akbar,' they are Muslims,” said Mir Saeed, a cleric.
This outpouring of support for the security forces began on Monday night in the city of Herat, in western Afghanistan, which has seen fierce fighting over the past few weeks and resisted Taliban attacks against Herat city over the past week. 
The campaign comes as Afghan security forces are fighting the Taliban in multiple areas across the country.
In response, the Taliban said that ""Allahu Akbar"" is the group's slogan and that those who abuse Allahu Akbar will be held accountable.
While the Afghans were chanting the slogan in Kabul on Tuesday night, the Taliban attacked the residence of acting Defense Minister Bismillah Mohammadi in downtown Kabul, killing at least eight people including a woman.

Clerics Urge Afghan Warring Sides to Engage in Political Dialogue
","
The Imamia High Council of Clerics on Thursday urged the Afghan warring parties--the Afghan government and the Taliban--to engage in political dialogue, saying the current war in the country has no religious legitimacy.
The council said that while the US  troops and their allies are on their way home from Afghanistan, no one should shed the blood of the Afghan people in the name of jihad or of defending Islam. They also said that religion should not be exploited for political and personal interests.
“I want to address both the Taliban and the Afghan government: Now that the foreigners have let, what justification remains for this war to be fought in the name of Sharia (Islamic law)? For the shedding of the people's blood?” said Mohammad Hussain Jaffari Kunduzi, the head of the Imamia High Council of Clerics.
“The Ulema (religious scholars) should keep their unity stronger now than at any other time and observe their responsibility,” said Sayed Jaffar, a cleric.
“You must consult your conscience, what is the justification of this war against the Muslims?” asked Mohammad Daud Mohammadi, a cleric.
“We call on the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the United Nations to help Afghanistan achieve peace,” said Ali Reza, a cleric.
The clerics call for peace as the scale of the war has dramatically increased in Afghanistan following the announcement by the US to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan by August 31.

Taliban Captures Capital of Nimroz Province
","
Taliban on Friday captured the city of Zaranj, the capital of Nimroz province on the border with Iran as the first provincial capital to be seized by the group since the Biden administration said it would completely withdraw US troops from the country.
Taliban attacked the provincial capital on Thursday night. Their attacks were followed by hundreds of residents of the city, flocking towards the border with Iran, in a desperate search for safety.
There are also reports that government assets were looted in different parts of the city.
Reports say that the Taliban after capturing Kanak district in Nimroz brutally executed at least 30 soldiers. But the Taliban have rejected the allegations, saying the soldiers were killed during clashes.
“All people including women and children had flocked there,” said a resident in Nimroz, referring to an attempt by hundreds of Nimroz residents to cross the border to Iran.
A video from Nimroz shows that several bodies purportedly of the government forces lying on the ground. The Taliban reportedly tortured the soldiers, maimed them and took out their eyes before killing them.
“Based on the international law, it is counted as a war crime, it is also against Islamic principles,” said Laal Gul Laal, the head of human rights organization.
“The rejection of all these killings on the battlefields doesn’t acquit them (Taliban) from responsibility,” said Zabihullah Farhang, a spokesman for Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission.

Helmand, Jawzjan Capitals Face Heavy Fighting in 24 Hours
","
In a shift of their attention from rural areas to capital cities, the Taliban conducted heavy attacks on the centers of Lashkargah city in Helmand and Sheberghan city in Jawzjan province in the last 24 hours, entering some key government facilities.
In Jawzjan, the group made some progress until Friday afternoon, but soon they were pushed back from the city.
The Defense Ministry in a statement late on Friday evening said the center of Sheberghan city was retaken by Afghan troops -- who were supported by Air Force and the local forces loyal to former vice president Abdul Rashid Dostum.
Jawzjan lawmakers said that heavy fighting was underway near the police headquarters, the office of the intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security (NDS), and the governor’s office in Sheberghan.
Mawlavi Abdul Hai, a member of the Jawzjan provincial council, said the security agencies are not paying the required attention to the province.
“Jawzjan is also part of the geography of Afghanistan,” he said. 
“The soldiers who fought for three or four months in Jawzjan were killed or wounded today. For God's sake, when you will address the issue of Sheberghan?” said MP Halima Sadaf Rahimi.
In Helmand, meanwhile, fighting continues in Lashkargah city’s District 1. Videos on social media show shops have caught fire in the ongoing clashes between government forces and the Taliban.
“What the central government is doing? Stop the violence,” said Mahmoud Khan, a civil society activist in Helmand.
“Civilians have been killed there. Government forces have been killed. Taliban have been killed, but no one is there to address this problem,” said Akhtar Mohammad, a presidential adviser.
Taliban attacked Lashkargah city a week ago, but the Afghan Special Forces launched an operation to repel their attack. 
Helmand residents said there has been no progress in the operations in terms of pushing back the Taliban from strategic areas in the city.
“Afghan forces conducted air and ground operations in Jawzjan and Helmand. Our operations will continue,” Defense Ministry spokesman Rohullah Ahmadzai said.
The Defense Ministry said that 406 Taliban fighters 209 more were wounded in Afghan forces operations in various parts of the country in the last 24 hours. Taliban has rejected the claim.
There were casualties among security forces as well. Sources said that at least 10 security force members, including a security officer for Farah, were killed in the province.

UN Envoy Seeks End to Taliban Attacks on Provincial Capitals
","
Seeking an end to the Taliban’s attacks on Afghan provincial capitals, the UN envoy for Afghanistan, Deborah Lyons, on Friday said the UN Security Council should issue a statement against such an attempt by the group as the human toll of this strategy is extremely distressing and the political message is even more deeply disturbing.
Addressing the UN Security Council’s special meeting on Afghanistan’s situation, the UN envoy said Afghanistan is now at a dangerous turning point, adding that ahead lies either a genuine peace negotiation or a tragically intertwined set of crises: an increasingly brutal conflict combined with an acute humanitarian situation and multiplying human rights abuses.
In the past weeks, the war in Afghanistan has entered a new, deadlier, and more destructive phase. The Taliban campaign during June and July to capture rural areas has achieved significant territorial gains. From this strengthened position they have begun to attack the larger cities.
""This is now a different kind of war, reminiscent of Syria recently or Sarajevo in the not-so-distant past. To attack urban areas is to knowingly inflict enormous harm and cause massive civilian casualties,"" she said.
Lyons said that today she focused on the war against cities because a party that was genuinely committed to a negotiated settlement would not risk so many civilian casualties because it would understand that the process of reconciliation will be more challenging the more blood is shed.
 “It would also recognize that they cannot risk the destruction of infrastructure that would be badly needed to rebuild the country once an agreement is reached. It should be made clear to the Taliban political commission that the exemptions to the travel ban and the high protocol with which they have been received by many of the countries were, in fact, predicated on a commitment and progress in the peace process,” she said.
According to her, 40 civilians were killed in Spin Boldak district in Kandahar after it was captured by the Taliban.
In Lashkargah city, the capital of Helmand province, she said that “at least 104 civilians were killed and 403 wounded since July 28.""
“In Kandahar, since the start of the offensive there, on 9 July, a month ago, more than 460 civilian casualties have been registered. Further to the west, in and around Herat, UNAMA has credible reports of over 135 civilian casualties from the onset of the Taliban offensive,” she said.
She said that there have been over 1,000 casualties last month.
Lyons said that despite expectations that the withdrawal of foreign forces would lead to a reduction in violence, but the level of civilian casualties has increased by 50 percent.
“There is a striking contrast between the activity on the battlefield and the quiet stalemate at the negotiation table in Doha—where we should be seeing the opposite: quiet on the battlefield and engagement around the negotiating table,” she said.
The appeal from the UN envoy comes at a time that the Taliban has significantly increased their attacks on Afghan provincial capitals.

White House ‘Concerned’ about Continued Taliban Violence
","
Recent actions by the Taliban will not help them gain international legitimacy, the White House said on Friday, after the group killed the Afghan government’s senior media officer in Kabul.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at the White House said the administration is “closely tracking” and is “concerned about” retaliatory killings of civilians.
“If the Taliban claim to want international legitimacy, these actions are not going to get them the legitimacy they seek. They do not have to stay on this trajectory. They could choose to devote the same energy to the peace process as they are to their military campaign,” Psaki said.
Taliban captured the city of Zaranj, the capital of Nimroz province in southwestern Afghanistan, on Friday. They also claimed responsibility for killing Dawa Khan Menapal, the head of the Afghan government’s media and information center.
“First, let me strongly condemn, on behalf of the government, of course, the assassination of Dawa Khan Menapal, the director of the Afghan governmental information media center. His murder follows the bombing attack in Kabul earlier this week, the targeting at the acting Afghan defense minister,” Psaki said. “The Taliban has claimed responsibility for this later attack, and there’s no reason to doubt reports they are responsible.”
At least eight people were killed and 20 were wounded in the Taliban’s failed assassination attempt of Acting Defense Minister Gen. Bismillah Mohammadi last week on Tuesday.

Public Property ‘Looted’ in Taliban-Held Areas in Nimroz

Some people flocked to loot public property from government institutions in the city of Zaranj, the capital of Nimroz province, after it fell to the Taliban on Friday, sparking strong reaction from residents of other provinces, as well as, religious scholars.
Many videos were released following the fall of Zaranj to the Taliban showing people carrying equipment as they took them out of government institutions, including governor’s compound.
Another footage from Zaranj shows prisoners escaping the main provincial prison. A similar scenario happened in Sheberghan, the capital of Jawzjan in northern Afghanistan, after it fell to the Taliban on Saturday.
“This shows the Taliban has no plan for governance or for providing service to the people,” presidential adviser Shahussain Murtazawi said. “This time, Talibs are following the policy of looting.”
“I have already mentioned that if the Taliban had the will to build, they should first come up with peace, sit with Afghans and build this country together,” Zabul provincial council’s chairman Ata Jan Haq Bayan said.
Religious scholars also condemned indifference to protection of public property by the people.
“Wasting public property is forbidden. Anyone who takes over public property, must protect it and must prevent its waste,” said Mawlawi Abdul Wadood, a religious scholar.
Ordinary Afghans asked the warring parties to protect public property in areas under their control.
“Looting public property is a war crime. It is inhuman,” said Kamran, a Kabul resident.
“Public property such as government buildings and bridges should be protected,” said Rashid Farhang, a Takhar resident.
As violence continues in the country, the government said last month that in the districts recently seized by the Taliban, essential government services have been halted, and a large number of civil servants have been harmed, or displaced from their areas to provincial capitals.
According to government findings, the Taliban either torched or destroyed 260 government buildings and assets in 116 districts.
The findings show that 13 million Afghans have been deprived of social services in the Taliban-held areas and 50,000 employees, including women, have been affected in areas under the influence of the group.
Taliban has rejected the findings. The group announced on Saturday that all government employees “will be safe” in areas under their control.

Afghans Question Govt’s Security Strategy amid Taliban Advances
","
Ordinary Afghans and critics on Saturday strongly criticized the Afghan government’s security strategy as the Taliban take over two provincial capitals within the span of only two days.
They said that the so-called public uprising forces have not played any crucial role in repulsing the Taliban’s military advancement towards major cities and strategic locations.
Footage on social media shows dozens of Afghan security forces along with their military equipment and vehicles are driving towards the border with Iran, leaving Zaranj city, the center of Nimroz province in southwestern Afghanistan, without any resistance.
“Poor leadership and lack of coordination in the past several years have led to this crisis,” said MP Khaled Assad.
“I call on our people not be deceived by empty promises in the future,” Wali, a resident in Kunduz said.
Soon after their emergence a month ago, the public uprising forces were expected to help the Afghan government forces in their campaign against the Taliban.
But critics said that the battle in Sheberghan showed that the public uprising forces did not accomplish their tasks contrary to what was expected from them. Critics said that in Sheberghan, only the son of Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum and his loyal forces resisted against the Taliban.
“Where are these leaders who were raising their voice for posts and seats,” said Salim Sahel, a resident of Kabul.
A spokesman for Dostum meanwhile said that the government did not deliver sufficient equipment in Sheberghan to help the public uprising forces to fight the Taliban.
“Public uprising forces so far have not received the support of the central government and today we see the fall of Sheberghan city,” said Abdul Kabir Haidari, a member of National Islamic Movemnet of Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, Marshal Dostum met with President Ashraf Ghani to discuss the overall security situation in the north.
“The main proposal of Marshal Dostum was the implementation of martial law in Afghanistan. The president today welcomed this suggestion,” said Ehsan Nairo, a spokesman to Dostum.
Three days back, President Ghani said that he has ordered the number of special operation forces to increase to to 45,000.
“The recruitment process of new commandos both from within the security forces and outside the structure of the security forces has started,” said Fawad Aman, a Defense Ministry spokesman.
Currently, around 20,000 officers are serving within the ranks of the Special Operation Forces.

Analysts Predict Decrease in Govt Revenue as Border Town Falls
","
Analysts predict that the fall of Zaranj city on the border with Iran will deprive the Afghan government from $175 million in revenue a year.
With the fall of Zaranj, the Taliban is now controlling at least 10 border towns, including Islam Qala and Torghundi in Herat, Abu Nasr-e-Farahi in Farah, Spin Boldak in Kandahar, Sher Khan in Kunudz, Dand-e-Pathan in Paktia, Ai Khanum in Takhar and Ishkashim crossing point in the northeastern province of Badakhshan.
“Main reasons are linked to government's failures, incompetency and corruption. They handed over a province like a district,” said Baz Mohammad Naser, head of Nimroz provincial council.
“Here, the people are screaming, but the border is closed,” said Mohammad Asfar, a resident of Nimroz.
The Afghan government is now controlling few border towns, including Aqian in Faryab, Hairatan in Balkh, Angor Ada in Paktika, Ghulam Khan in Khost and Torkham crossing in the eastern province of Nangarhar.
The fall of Zaranj has also raised deep concerns over a surge in the smuggling of fuel to Afghanistan.
Nimroz besides enjoying bordres with Iran and Pakistan is also the monitoring point of the Helmand river from where the water flows to Afghanistan’s newly built Kamal Khan and Salma dams in Herat.
“Other ports that we had in the west are now out of the government control. I think this will create a major problem for the central government,” said MP Farishta Amini.
“The Afghan businessmen are facing the great loss due to the current situation in Nimroz,” said Massoud Forogh, former head of fuel department in the north zone.
The Taliban’s control in Spin Boldak has left hundreds of convoys and passengers stranded along the Durand Line.
On Friday, the Taliban closed Spin Boldak crossing for a while, saying the Pakistani government is implementing a transportation mechanism that it has signed with the Afghan government, not with them.
Zaranj is the first provincial capital that has fallen to the Taliban. The Taliban also took the control of Sheberghan city on Saturday.

","
US President Joe Biden has ordered B-52 bombers and Spectre gunships to target Taliban positions in Afghanistan who are advancing towards key cities, MailOnline reported on Saturday as embattled Afghan security forces are fighting the resurgent group in various parts of the country.
These bombers are being supported by the AC-130 Spectre gunships which are armed with a 25mm Gatling gun, a 40mm Bofors cannon and a 105mm M102 cannon, which can provide pinpoint accurate fire from the air, the report said.
Afghan security forces and the Taliban are engaged in fierce fighting in the capital cities of Kunduz, Takhar and Badakhshan provinces in the north of Afghanistan.
The Public Health Directorate in Kunduz said that 11 civilians were killed and 39 more were wounded in fresh spate of clashes in the city of Kunduz that started on Friday evening.
In Badakhshan, police said Taliban attacks on the city of Faizabad were pushed back by Afghan forces.
Taliban Captures 2nd Provincial Capital in Two Days
The strategic city of Sheberghan, the capital of Jawzjan province in northern Afghanistan, fell to the Taliban after one week of clashes, sources confirmed.
Sources said that security forces are stationed only at the provincial airport in Khwaja Dako district, which is the hometown of former vice president Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum and is located 17 kilometers from the city of Sheberghan.
Sheberghan is the second provincial capital to fall to the Taliban in the last two days.
Jawzjan lawmakers blamed the government for inattention to the security situation in Jawzjan and said it has remained indifferent to this matter.
On Friday, Taliban captured Zaranj city, the capital of Nimroz province in southwestern Afghanistan. Zaranj fell to the Taliban with no resistance by government forces.
This comes as President Ghani met with former vice president Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum on Saturday and discussed the country’s security situation, especially the situation in northern provinces, the Presidential Palace said.
In this meeting, Dostum vowed his full support to Afghan forces and said the time has come to make effort for improving the country’s security situation and for defending Afghanistan’s values.
Dostum’s spokesman Ehsanullah Nairo said that Dostum presented his plan for the improvement of the security situation to the president, and it was accepted by President Ghani.
Afghans Question Govt’s Security Strategy amid Taliban Advances
Ordinary Afghans and critics on Saturday strongly criticized the Afghan government’s security strategy as the Taliban take over two provincial capitals within the span of only two days.
They said that the so-called public uprising forces have not played any crucial role in repulsing the Taliban’s military advancement towards major cities and strategic locations.
Footage on social media shows dozens of Afghan security forces along with their military equipment and vehicles are driving towards the border with Iran, leaving Zaranj city, the center of Nimroz province in southwestern Afghanistan, without any resistance.
But critics said that the battle in Sheberghan showed that the public uprising forces did not accomplish their tasks contrary to what was expected from them. Critics said that in Sheberghan, only the son of Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum and his loyal forces resisted against the Taliban.

Washington Policy Behind Current Crisis: Afghan Senator
","
The deputy speaker of the Afghan Senate, Mohammad Alam Izedyar, said that Washington’s policy to recognize the Taliban and the Afghan government at the same time has led to the current crisis in Afghanistan, citing the fact that the signing of the Doha agreement and the Kabul-Washington security pact occurred on the same day. 
He made the remarks at a session focused on supporting Afghan forces during which participants stressed the need for both sides to return to peace negotiations.
“Even if the Taliban captures Afghanistan militarily, it will not mean sovereignty, it will not mean stability. The war will continue. Resistance will continue,” Izedyar said.
He added: “From one side, they signed a security agreement with the Afghan government while on the other they signed an agreement with the Taliban and recognized two parties in Afghanistan. That was the start of the new crisis in Afghanistan.”
The participants of the event said that the only way out of the current crisis is to focus on peace.
“Convince them. Ask them to talk. Talk to them. Find a solution. We should save Afghanistan,” said Shalizi Didar, head of the Kabul residents’ council.
“This country belongs to all ethnic groups. If it is fine, it will benefit everyone and if there is damage it will damage everyone,” said Ahmad Husain, a civil society activist.
The Taliban mounted attacks after the announcement of the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan. Their attacks are now focused on Afghan provincial capitals.

Reports of War Crimes, Images of Killed Children Grip Nation
","
As the war spreads to urban, populated areas, reports are emerging of human rights violations and civilian casualties in the fighting between government forces and the Taliban.
In one instance footage shows children in the city of Taluqan, the capital of the northern province of Takhar, lying on the ground with blood-stained faces.  They were reportedly killed in rocket attacks.
The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission said that the Taliban has committed “war crimes” in Malistan district in Ghazni. But the Taliban has rejected the findings.
A young man named Mahdi, a resident of Malistan district, said that he was tortured by the Taliban after he attempted to save his parents. Mahdi said he was beaten by the Taliban for having taken a photo of himself beside Afghanistan’s flag.
“I told them that my father is ill and I want to take him to the doctor. They took my phone from my bag and a camera and broke them. They beat me without any reason and hit me with the butt end of their rifle,” said Mahdi.
The Taliban did not comment on the claims, but the human rights commission said there are many reports of war crimes, torture, and human rights violations by the Taliban in areas under their influence.
“The Taliban has deliberately and with ‘full brutality’ killed 27 civilians, including a woman, in Malistan district, and 10 more have been wounded,” said Zabihullah Farhang, the head of media office of the commission.
Another video circulating on social media shows a child killed in a rocket attack in the city of Taluqan.
The Taliban on Sunday captured the central prison in Taluqan city, Takhar province, and launched attacks to overrun the governor’s compound, the police headquarters, and the NDS office in the province.
“Anyone who turns their attention away from Takhar will be responsible in the future. Our areas (of control) are getting limited,” said Pir Mohammad Khaksar, a commander of public uprising forces in Takhar.
“They are strangers. They are Pakistanis. They are our enemies,” said Pahlawan Ibrahim, a former mujahedeen commander.
Footage of Nijrab district in the central province of Kapisa shows people leaving their homes due to the ongoing fighting in the district, which fell to the Taliban last month but was retaken earlier this month.
“The situation is worse. The Taliban has made their strongholds among houses,” said Abdullah a Nijrab resident.
“I have not earned even 20 Afs. The monthly rent for my shop is 7,000 Afs. And I cannot afford it,” said Sayed Agha, a Nijrab resident.
Previously watchdog organizations accused the Taliban of committing war crimes in areas under the group's control in Spin Boldak district in Kandahar province and in Faryab province.
The US Chargé d’Affaires Ross Wilson on August 6 said that “the Taliban’s violence and hate have never been sustainable forms of governance.”
He said: “the group’s previous beheadings, as well as current offensive and targeted killings, show that they only know violence and are scared of peace. We urge them to choose peace.”

Key Areas in 2 Northern Afghan Cities Fall Amid Clashes
","
Central parts of the city of Sar-e-Pul and many areas in Kunduz city have fallen to the Taliban after heavy clashes between the two sides.  
Reports indicate that in Sar-e-Pul the governor’s compound, the police headquarters and the NDS office have fallen to the Taliban.  
Local officials said that security forces are stationed in an army base in Sar-e-Pul and in Balkhab district of Sar-e-Pul, as well as in two areas in Kunduz. Other areas have fallen to the Taliban. 
Taliban attacks on these two northern cities intensified over the last 24 hours after the Taliban took Sheberghan, the provincial capital in Jawzjan.
“The only remaining area is held by a regiment in the center of Sar-e-Pul province and (another) in Balkhab district,” said Behzad Haidarizada, a Sar-e-Pul resident.
“The central and local governments have paid no attention. The security forces did not even have food while they were under siege,” said Yar Mohammad Maihanparast, the head of the Sar-e-Pul residents' council in Kabul.
Some lawmakers from Sar-e-Pul said the government’s inattention led to the fall of the city and the loss of dozens of large pieces of military equipment to the Taliban.
“The inefficient officials in Sar-e-Pul made the situation worse and provided the grounds for collapse. I believe that Sar-e-Pul collapsed due to a deal,” said Sayed Hayatullah Alemi, an MP from Sar-e-Pul.
Videos from Kunduz show people fleeing their houses to avoid firing from either side. The videos also show bodies lying on the road in the city of Kunduz.
The Taliban released videos showing they had overrun the main roundabout in the center of Kunduz city, an area that was taken over by the group two times in 2015 and 2016.
The governor’s compound, the police headquarters and the NDS office in Kunduz have all fallen to the Taliban. Fighting has intensified on Kunduz streets, sources said.
“The security agencies, especially the Defense Ministry, paid no attention and did not provide support,” said Nilofar Jalali Kofi, an MP from Kunduz.
But security forces pledged that they will defend the city of Kunduz and its residents against Taliban attacks.
“The enemy suffered heavy casualties in areas they were attempting to capture,” said Haji Mohammad, the commander of the 2nd regiment of commando troops in Kunduz.
“Efforts are underway to make the situation normal in those provinces,” said Defense Ministry spokesman Fawad Aman.
Lawmakers from Sar-e-Pul and Kunduz warned that neighboring cities of the two provinces will also fall to the Taliban if the government does not pay the required attention to protect northern areas.

Govt Criticized for Fall of Strategic Areas in North
","
Lawmakers from Kunduz and Jawzjan strongly blasted the government, accusing it of not paying sufficient attention to the situation in the north as the Taliban gain control of strategic areas, including Jawzjan's provincial capital Sheberghan and parts of Kunduz city in Kunduz province.
They said other cities in the north are currently threatened.
“The situation in Kunduz affects the situation in Takhar and Baghlan. And is an important location,” said Mirza Mohammad Yarmand, the former deputy minister of interior.
“The Taliban was focused on Kunduz as an important location but the government saw it as a small village,” said Rabbani Rabbani, a member of Kunduz's provincial council.
A group of Kunduz residents held a rally in front of the Presidential Palace on Sunday, criticizing a lack of support for troops in the province.
“Our people have no shelter. Those who are in Kabul have no place to live. Others have been caught there. Some have been killed and wounded,” said Jawad Rafat, a Kunduz resident who attended a rally in Kabul.
“Kunduz is called the 'little Afghanistan' because it houses all respected ethnic groups. Now they have concentrated the power with one team or group,” said Amruddin Wali, the head of the Kunduz provincial council.
Meanwhile, some members of the National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan (Junbish-e-Milli) said that more cities in the north will come under threat if the Taliban advances are not prevented in Kunduz. 
“The issue is there was a rivalry between Marshal Dostum and others--some who did not want Junbish joined the Taliban; otherwise the Taliban would not have had the ability to overrun Jawzjan,” said Bahruddin Jawzjani, a tribal elder from Jawzjan.
“If the government does not start an operation, it will have a negative impact on all the northern and northeastern provinces,” said Halima Sadaf Karimi, an MP from Jawzjan.  
As concerns grow about the country’s situation, government officials have spoken about President Ghani’s security plan, but the details of the plan have not yet been made public. According to the Presidential Palace, President Ghani has discussed the plan in his recent meetings with a number of political leaders.

Ex-NSA Spanta Calls to Equip, Supply Public Uprising Forces
","
Former national security adviser Rangin Dadfar Spanta suggested that to prevent the fall of Herat city to the Taliban, there is a need to equip and supply the public uprising forces led by former mujahedeen leader Mohammad Ismail Khan.
He criticized the government’s “wrong” policies toward ceasefire agreements, which, he cautioned, could strengthen the Taliban and increase violence in the country. The plan, according to Spanta, called for announcing a ceasefire in certain parts of the country.
“If the plan is to ensure ceasefire for instance in great Kandahar or great Paktia, in this case, the national unity and morale will be affected and all will find an opportunity to attack Herat,” Spanta said.
He made the remarks at a session hosted by the Afghan Institute for Strategic Studies focused on the situation in Herat.
“The situation will definitely worsen if this inattention continues and we do not support the resistance force,” said Saleh Mohammad Saljoqi, a former MP from Herat.
“A wild force comes that is not accountable,” said Mohammad Nasir Foshanji, a Herat resident, speaking of the Taliban.
The fighting in Herat has decreased over the last two days but is close to the central parts of the city.

Afghanistan: 27 children Killed in Just 3 Days, UN Agency Says
","
The UN's agency for children, UNICEF, in a statement on Monday said that 27 children were killed and 136 more were wounded in ongoing fighting in Kandahar, Khost and Paktia provinces in the last 72 hours.
The UN agency said it is ""shocked by the rapid escalation of grave violations against children"" in Afghanistan.
According to the agency, 20 children were killed and 130 more were wounded in Kandahar; 2 children were killed and 3 more were wounded in Khost; 5 children were killed and 3 more were wounded in Paktia in the last 72 hours.
The atrocities grow higher by the day, the agency says.
“These are not numbers. Each one of these deaths and each case of physical suffering is a personal tragedy,” UNICEF envoy in Afghanistan Hervé Ludovic De Lys said in a statement. “These children are much loved and longed-for daughters and sons, brothers and sisters, cousins and friends. All of them are children whose right to protection, under international humanitarian law, has been disregarded by warring parties.”
UNICEF said that these atrocities are also evidence of the ""brutal nature and scale of violence in Afghanistan which preys on already vulnerable children.""
On top of this ""appalling situation,"" UNICEF said, it is also ""deeply concerned about reports that children are, increasingly, being recruited into the conflict by armed groups.""
The agency said that many other boys and girls are deeply traumatized as they witness atrocities committed against their families and others in their communities.
UNICEF said that children should not pay for this worsening conflict with their childhoods and that only a complete end of hostilities can protect Afghanistan’s children.
As long as the conflict rages, children’s ""right to thrive is compromised; their futures jeopardized, and their contributions to their nation’s prospects diminished,"" the agency said.
UNICEF called on all those engaged in mediation efforts to hold the warring parties to their international obligations to children.

The city of Aybak, the capital of the northern province of Samangan, fell to the Taliban on Monday, MPs confirmed.

Zarang, capital of Nimruz, Sheberghan, capital of Jawzjan province, Taloqan, capital of Takhar, Sar-e-Pul, capital of Sar-e-Pul province and now Aybak, capital of Samangan, are the cities that are under Taliban control.
The residents of Aybak accused the central government of negligence.
MPs from Samangan in Parliament said that the security forces left the city without fighting.
“Unfortunately, Aybak, the city in Samangan, fell to the Taliban today about 2:30pm (local time). The government forces retreated from the city and now the Taliban has entered and captured the police HQ and the National Directorate of Security (NDS) building,” said Abdalelah Mohammadi, an MP from Samangan.
In recent days the Taliban intensified their attacks in the northern parts of the country, especially in Jawzjan, Samangan, Takhar, Balkh, Kunduz and Sar-e-Pul provinces.
Taloqan fell to the Taliban late Sunday after weeks of fighting with security forces and public uprising forces.
Local officials said hundreds of the security forces retreated from Taloqan and moved to Farkhar and Warsaj districts in the province and have retaken the two districts from the Taliban.
“Takhar has been at war for the past 40 days and witnessed heavy clashes…. The people are concerned about the situation and most of the people have left their homes and moved to other provinces,” said Faramarz Amiri, a resident of Takhar.
Ramazan, another resident of Takhar, said: “The security forces and public uprising forces have been fighting for  the past 40 days and standing against the Taliban without the support of the central government. Unfortunately, the lack of equipment and central government’s support has caused Taloqan to fall to the Taliban.”
In Kunduz city, clashes have been ongoing between the security forces and the Taliban for the past two days.
Despite the loss of the provincial governor's office, police HQ and NDS building, the government forces are still fighting the Taliban close to the 217 Pamir Corps and airport.
“Clashes are ongoing in Kunduz city close to the remaining government buildings,” said Mohammad Yousuf Ayoubi, head of the provincial council of Kunduz.
Officials of the Parliament's defense commission have urged the government to take immediate action against the Taliban’s advance, saying: “If immediate action does not take place, other cities will also fall to the Taliban.”
But the security organizations are assuring the people that the cities will be retaken.
Currently, the Taliban has increased pressure on Faizabad city, capital of the northeastern province of Badakhshan; Maimana, capital of Faryab; Pul-e-Khumri in Baghlan and Mazar-e-Sharif, capital of Balkh province.
The Afghan security forces pushed back a Taliban attack in the Dehdadi district of Balkh, the Defense Ministry said on Monday, adding: “The Taliban left the area after suffering heavy casualties.”
The Taliban claim, however, their fighters clashed with security forces in the Kod-e-Barq area and govt forces sustained casualties.
The National Army's 209 Shaheen Corps, which is one of the security forces' largest military bases, is also located in the district.
Dehdadi borders Mazar e Sharif city.

Ghani, Political Leaders Agree on Public Forces Command Center
","
A group of political leaders and President Ashraf Ghani at a meeting on Monday agreed to form a joint command center for public uprising forces to better manage, equip and strengthen them in the fight against the Taliban, sources said.
Abdullah Abdullah, chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, and other political leaders including Abdul Rab Rasul Sayyaf, Mohammad Yunus Qanooni, Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum, Mohammad Mohaqiq, as well as the speakers of the National Assembly attended the meeting at the Presidential Palace on Monday, according to a Palace statement.
“They agreed on mobilization, strengthening and the rapid equipping of public uprising forces within the framework of the government” to fight the Taliban, the Palace said after the meeting.
Sources said that key political leaders will be part of this command center, which will mobilize people in various areas to fight the Taliban.
The development comes as Abdullah Abdullah and other political figures discussed the formation of the command center in a meeting at his office earlier this week.
It also comes amid a rapid spread of the fighting to the country’s provincial capitals. Five provincial capitals have fallen to the Taliban in just four days.
Sources said that the politicians involved in the matter will determine how many forces they can mobilize and in which areas they will fight the Taliban.
The decision comes a day after Dostum met with President Ghani, and according to Dostum’s aide, the nation's top general suggested imposing martial law.
“Today, the political leaders suggested that a big military responsibility should be given to Marshal Dostum,” he said.
Analysts said there is a need for a sophisticated management system for the security forces in their fight against the Taliban.
“In war, even a one-minute opportunity is very important. In war, the plans that are made should be implemented quickly,” military affairs analyst Mehrabuddin Safi said.
“It will not be effective if we don’t see efficiency in action,” said Hamidudin Yuldash, an MP from Jawzjan.
The sources also said that amid these efforts to boost the strength of the frontlines against the Taliban, Abdullah Abdullah is expected to travel to Doha on Monday evening for a three-day session there.
Representatives of regional countries as well as the EU and the US are also expected to attend the three meetings on Afghan peace. But it is not clear whether Abdullah will meet with Taliban leaders in Doha.

Displaced Families from North Sleeping in Open Air in Kabul
","
Dozens of families from Kunduz, Takhar and Badakhshan provinces sought refuge in Kabul after fleeing the fighting in the three northern provinces. They arrived in Kabul on Sunday evening and spent the night in the open air.
The families said they ""lost everything” in the war. Every family has its own bitter story of the ongoing violence that has overwhelmed the country. Some of those who spoke to TOLOnews have lost loved ones, their houses, and other belongings, and some have been wounded in the recent fighting.
Five cities fell to the Taliban in the last four days, an occurrence not seen for the last 20 years.
In one instance four children from the same family slept in the open air. The mother of these children, Shaima, said she left everything in the city of Kunduz and came here with family members.
“Bombs came from one side and bullets from another. Homes were destroyed,” Shaima said.
“Who is interested in leaving their home and living in this dust?” said Abdul Qayum, a displaced person from Kunduz.
The displaced residents blamed the government for not addressing their condition. Malika, a resident of Kunduz, said she gave her jewelry to a driver to take her and her family to Kabul.
“The president harmed the honor of this people. Abdullah during elections did not agree on a 50-50 government. Now why is he not going to the frontlines like Ismail Khan?” Malika said.
Some of the displaced families are from Takhar province, the majority of which are from the provincial capital Taluqan city. They said that heavy mortar fire landed in their neighborhood, compelling them to leave their homes.
“Four children were killed in our neighborhood when a rocket hit their home. Ultimately, we left everything and left,” said a Takhar resident who has been displaced.
A volunteer group helping displaced people said that so far they have determined that 30 children need treatment for illness.
“The patients are in a bad condition. They should be admitted to a hospital,” said Sharafuddin Amiri, a doctor.
The displaced people said they see Kabul as their only place to be safe from the ongoing fighting, as the border with Iran and Pakistan is not open to those who leave their homes due to conflicts.
Some of the displaced families are in Sarai Shamali in the north of Kabul and others are in the Shahre Naw area in downtown Kabul.
“Time to use the emergency fund. It should not be embezzled,” said Naqib, a Kunduz resident.

Pakistan FM Criticizes ANDSF, Denies Helping Taliban
","
Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi on Monday said the international community needed to look into the failures of Afghan security forces in the face of Taliban offensives across Afghanistan, Reuters reported. 
Taliban fighters have swiftly gained territory across Afghanistan since May, including six provincial capitals in the last three days, as international forces near a complete withdrawal from the country after 20 years of fighting. 
""The capacity-building, the training, the equipment... where is it?"" Qureshi said at a news conference quoted by Reuters. 
Pakistan cannot be held responsible for the failure of others, he further said. 
Kabul and several western governments said Pakistan's support for the Taliban allowed it to weather 20 years of war after being pushed from power in 2001 by a US-led invasion of Afghanistan, the report said. 
The group today controls more territory than that at any point since 2001. 
Pakistan denies supporting the Taliban. Qureshi said Islamabad was not taking sides in Afghanistan. 
""The lack of will to fight, the capitulation that we are seeing in Afghanistan... can we be held responsible for that? No, we cannot,"" Qureshi said, adding that Pakistan supported a political solution to bring peace to Afghanistan. 
Qureshi said Islamabad was concerned at the violence and the lack of progress in peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government, saying that Pakistan had most to lose from an unstable Afghanistan as a direct neighbor. 
A protracted war in Afghanistan is Pakistan's “nightmare scenario,” the country's national security advisor to Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Monday, according to an AP report. 
Moeed Yusuf said Pakistan is pushing the Taliban to return to negotiations, but its leverage is waning as the insurgent group gains more ground in Afghanistan. 
Yusuf also attacked the performance of Afghanistan's National Defense and Security Forces, claiming over a trillion dollars was put into Afghanistan: ""What is going on with this well-equipped and trained force?”
In their sweep through Afghanistan, which began with the late April start of the final withdrawal of US and NATO troops, the Taliban have gained control of strategic and lucrative border crossings, including the Spin Boldak crossing with Pakistan. 
Last weekend the Taliban closed it, after Islamabad demanded that Afghans crossing to the Pakistani side have a passport and a Pakistani visa, something that had not previously been required.

Over 4,000 Wounded Afghans Treated by ICRC in 10 Days
","
Since the beginning of August, 4,042 weapon-wounded patients have been treated at 15 health facilities supported by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), an indication of the intensity of the recent violence, the organization said in a statement on Wednesday.
Hundreds of thousands of civilians are at risk as fighting intensifies in and around Kunduz, Lashkar Gah, Kandahar, and other Afghan cities.  
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has called on both warring sides to show restraint and protect civilians and vital infrastructure such as hospitals from attacks, especially in urban areas. 
“We are seeing homes destroyed, medical staff and patients put at tremendous risk, and hospitals, electricity and water infrastructure damaged,” said Eloi Fillion, ICRC’s head of delegation in Afghanistan. “The use of explosive weaponry in cities is having severe and indiscriminate effects on the civilian population well beyond its target. Many families have no option but to flee in search of a safer place. This must stop.” 
Street-to-street clashes in Kunduz, Lashkar Gah and other cities over the last few days have injured hundreds of civilians even as medical services are heavily strained due to damage to health facilities and a lack of staff, the ICRC said in a statement.  
The ICRC says that electricity is out across several contested cities and water supply systems are barely operational in some places. “Many families are trying to leave but cannot find transport to escape or simply do not have the financial means,” ICRC said. 
The ICRC and its partner the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) say they are operating at full capacity to evacuate the wounded and transport the remains of those killed as a result of the conflict. In July alone, the ICRC helped nearly 13,000 patients suffering from weapon-related injuries across the country, and this number appears likely to rise this month as fighting increases in highly populated areas. 
“Health-care facilities, medical workers, and ambulances must be spared at all cost,” said Fillion. “We also call on all fighting parties to allow humanitarian organizations like the ICRC and ARCS to safely evacuate the injured and bring much-needed assistance to the civilian population.”

US in Talks With Pakistan on Insurgent Safe Havens: Pentagon
","
Pentagon Press Secretary John F. Kirby at a press conference on Monday said that talks with Pakistan continue over the insurgents’ safe havens.
“We continue to have conversations with Pakistani leadership about the safe havens that exist along that border between Afghanistan and Pakistan,” Kirby said. “And we're mindful that -- that those safe havens are only providing a source of more insecurity, more instability inside Afghanistan.”
“And we're not bashful about having that discussion with Pakistani leaders. We're also mindful that Pakistan and the Pakistani people also are -- fall victim to terrorist activities that emanate from that same region” he said.
“So, we're all -- we all have a shared sense of -- of the importance of closing down those safe havens and -- and not allowing them to be used by the Taliban or other insurgent networks to sow discord. And again, we're having that conversation with the Pakistanis all the time,” he further said.
On support for the Afghan government forces, he said that the US is “continuing to support them -- and I assume you're asking about airstrikes, I'm guessing? Because we are helping Afghan forces in a myriad of other ways.”
“But I'm assuming that's your question. And as I said, nothing has changed about the fact that we have the authorities to do it throughout the drawdown,” he noted.
“We have some capability to do it from obviously over the horizon, and the strikes that we have taken have all been from over the horizon. And we'll continue to use those capabilities where and when feasible,” he stated.
“It's not always going to be feasible in every case. And the Taliban has been making advances; there's no question. The Afghans have capacity; they have capability, they have a capable Air Force,” accruing to Kirby.
“And as I said, weeks ago, I think, whatever the outcome here, when we look back, we're going to be able to know, we're going to be able to say, that it was driven by leadership, Afghan leadership, political and military leadership, that's what's vital here,” he said.
“We want all neighboring countries, all neighboring countries, to -- to not take actions that make the situation in Afghanistan more dangerous than it is already, and to continue to try to use international pressure to get a negotiated peaceful political settlement to this war,” said Kirby.
Seeking an end to the Taliban’s attacks on Afghan provincial capitals, the UN envoy for Afghanistan, Deborah Lyons, on Friday said the UN Security Council should issue a statement against such an attempt by the group as the human toll of this strategy is extremely distressing and the political message is even more deeply disturbing.
Addressing the UN Security Council’s special meeting on Afghanistan’s situation, the UN envoy said Afghanistan is now at a dangerous turning point, adding that ahead lies either a genuine peace negotiation or a tragically intertwined set of crises: an increasingly brutal conflict combined with an acute humanitarian situation and multiplying human rights abuses.
In the past weeks, the war in Afghanistan has intensified. The Taliban campaign during June and July to capture rural areas has achieved significant territorial gains. From this strengthened position they have begun to attack the larger cities.
In recent days the Taliban intensified their attacks in the northern parts of the country, especially in Jawzjan, Samangan, Takhar, Balkh, Kunduz and Sar-e-Pul provinces.
With Aybak, capital of Samangan province which fell on Monday, the number of cities that fell to the Taliban recently has risen to five.
Zarang, capital of Nimruz, Sheberghan, capital of Jawzjan province, Taloqan, capital of Takhar, Sar-e-Pul, capital of Sar-e-Pul province and now Aybak, are the cities that are under Taliban control.

Petition Calls on World to Protect Afghan Journalists, Artists
","
More than 80 personalities--including well-known actresses Juliette Binoche and Tilda Swinton--have signed a petition initiated by Afghan-French author and filmmaker Atiq Rahimi, Afghan filmmaker Siddiq Barmak, and Iranian filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf, calling on the international community to grant asylum or other assistance to Afghan journalists, artists and independent filmmakers who are now especially vulnerable as the Taliban increasingly gains territory in the country amid the US troop withdrawal.
The open letter noted that while the US is providing visa opportunities for interpreters and other Afghan staff who had worked for US forces, there are limited provisions for journalists and artists--including independent filmmakers--whose lives are at risk.
""The international coalition in Afghanistan has made it a priority to save the lives of local translators and their families. But it seems that no one cares about Afghan journalists, artists and independent filmmakers. They are priority targets for the Taliban, whose relentless hatred for culture and civilization needs no further proof!""  an English version of the statement reads, adding: ""They are not only the conscience of their people, but, like all artists, the conscience of all mankind, against whom the Taliban--the barbarian fanatics--have declared war.""
Those who signed the petition include filmmakers, writers, actors and journalists.
The petition says: ""Let’s help these witnesses of barbarism, against whom these fundamentalists have declared war. We must act urgently to protect their lives, ensure their security in Afghanistan, or grant them political asylum in free/democratic countries.""
""Otherwise,"" the petition concludes, ""their killing by the Taliban will weigh heavily on our conscience and the horror of fundamentalism will win over the humanist dawn! Let's open the doors of all the embassies to them.""

UN Seeks Action to Prevent ‘Calamitous Consequences’ for Afghans
","
A senior UN official on Tuesday warned that the failure to stem the rising violence and human rights violations and abuses is having disastrous consequences for the people of Afghanistan.
The remarks come as civilian casualties continue to mount and reports of violations that may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity continued to emerge.
“We know that urban warfare results in scores of civilians being killed,” said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet. “We have seen it before, too many times.”
Bachelet said that “at least 183 civilians have been killed and 1,181 injured, including children,” in the cities of Lashkar Gah, Kandahar, Herat and Kunduz since July 9.
“These are just the civilian casualties we managed to document,” she said, adding that “the real figures will be much higher.
The UN official called on parties to the conflict to stop fighting to prevent more bloodshed.
“The Taliban must cease their military operations in cities,” she said. “Unless all parties return to the negotiating table and reach a peaceful settlement, the already atrocious situation for so many Afghans will become much worse.”
Bachelet also urged all States to use their influence – bilaterally and multilaterally – to bring the hostilities to an end.
“States have a duty to use any leverage they have to de-escalate the situation and reinvigorate peace processes. The fighting must be brought to an end,” the UN high commissioner stressed, noting the peace-related meetings taking place this week in Doha. 
According to reports documented by the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and the UN Human Rights Office, most of the civilian harm is being caused by ground engagements. Airstrikes have also resulted in civilian casualties. In addition, since the start of the May Taliban offensive, at least 241,000 people have been displaced, and the protracted fighting in the cities has resulted in damage to essential infrastructure like roads and bridges, and other civilian objects.
In the southern city of Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province, in the 13 days after July 28, when fighting started in the city, the UN received reports of at least 139 civilians killed and 481 injured.
The real numbers are expected to be much higher as communication with the city is intermittently cut off and many civilians wounded by the fighting are unable to reach hospitals. By August 5, hospitals were nearly at full capacity. On July 31 a private clinic was significantly damaged by an Afghan National Army airstrike, leaving one civilian dead and five injured. The available food supply in the city is fast diminishing, said UN reports, and shortages of medical supplies were also reported. Electricity and water were cut off in most parts of the city.
The UN official said that the sweeping takeover of an estimated 192 district administrative centers by the Taliban, the attacks on provincial capitals including Qala-e-Naw, Kandahar, Lashkar Gah, Herat, Faizabad, Ghazni, Maimana, Gardez, Faizabad, Pul-e- Khumri, and Mazar-e-Sharif, and the takeover of at least six provincial capitals - Zaranj in Nimroz province, Sheberghan in Jawzjan province, Kunduz City in Kunduz province, Taluqan in Takhar province, Sar-e-Pul in Sar-e-Pul province and Aybak in Samangan province “have struck fear and dread into the population.”
She warned that the proliferation of pro-government militias being mobilized against the Taliban may also put civilians in additional danger.
In the areas that have already been captured by the Taliban and in contested areas, Bachelet said the Office was receiving reports of summary executions, attacks against current and former government officials and their family members, military use and destruction of homes, schools and clinics, and the laying of large numbers of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), including pressure-plate IEDs which function as anti-personnel landmines.
The UN is also receiving other deeply disturbing reports of serious violations of international humanitarian law such as killings by the Taliban of hors de combat members of Afghan security forces – in some cases after they had even received letters guaranteeing their safety upon surrendering. Orders issued by members of the local Afghan National Police not to spare captured or surrendering Taliban members are also prohibited under international humanitarian law.
Bachelet reminded all parties of their obligation to take all necessary measures to protect civilians, especially when fighting in populated areas. Directing attacks against civilians is a serious violation of international humanitarian law and amounts to a war crime. Perpetrators of serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law must be held accountable, she stressed.
The High Commissioner also expressed particular concern about early indications that the Taliban are imposing severe restrictions on human rights in the areas under their control, particularly targeting women. “People rightly fear that a seizure of power by the Taliban will erase the human rights gains of the past two decades,” she said.
“We have received reports that women and girls in various districts under Taliban control are prohibited from leaving their homes without a Mahram, a male chaperone. These restrictions have a serious impact on the rights of women, including the right to health – and clearly, in the midst of a war, the need to access urgent medical care for themselves and their families is a matter of life and death. Hampering a woman's ability to leave home without a male escort also inevitably leads to a cascade of other violations of the woman's and her family's economic and social rights,” Bachelet warned.
UN office said that in several locations, the Taliban have reportedly threatened that violation of these rules would result in harsh punishments. There are already reports of women having been flogged and beaten in public because they breached the prescribed rules. In one case in Balkh province, on August 3, a women's rights activist was shot and killed for breaching the rules.
Serious curbs on the freedom of expression and the ability of journalists to do their crucial work by both parties are also of deep concern during this time of uncertainty and chaos, the High Commissioner said.
“The people of Afghanistan are speaking of their deep fears of a return to the worst of the human rights violations of the past,” Bachelet said. “Women, minorities, human rights defenders, journalists as well as others who are particularly vulnerable need particular protection. There are very real risks of renewed atrocities against ethnic and religious minorities.”
“We will continue to monitor the human rights situation, in spite of security and other challenges, and I urge the international community, including through the Human Rights Council and the Security Council, to take urgent action to prevent further atrocities and to ensure that civilians in Afghanistan do not – once again – have to bear the brunt, and aftermath, of a prolonged and deadly conflict,” she concluded.

Politicians Continue to Discuss Public Forces Command Center
","
President Ashraf Ghani held separate meetings with political leaders about their decision to form a command center for public uprising forces in the fight against the Taliban. The discussions focused on the details of the plan, sources said.
The decision was made in a meeting of political leaders with President Ghani on Monday.
The meetings that followed the leaders’ session included Ghani’s meeting with former vice president Mohammad Karim Khalili, Second Vice President Mohammad Sarwar Danesh, presidential adviser and head of People's Islamic Unity Party of Afghanistan Mohammad Mohaqiq and a senior member of Hizb-e-Wahdat, Sadiq Mudabir, who all have an influence on central parts of Afghanistan, sources said.
More meetings are expected to occur between President Ghani and political leaders from various parts of the country to discuss the details of mobilizing public forces under the command center, sources said.
Monday’s meeting was also attended by Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum, the former vice president, who was reportedly one of the political figures to have suggested the plan. Dostum’s office said that the president has not provided a clear response regarding Dostum’s trip to the north and leading the war against the Taliban.
“We are waiting for the president to announce the date for the trip, equipment and supplying of Marshal Dostum to the north,” Dostum’s spokesman Ihsan Nairo said.
His office also said that Dostum is in Kabul, rejecting reports that he had traveled to the northern province of Balkh on Tuesday.
“Political leaders of the country unanimously announced their support for the system and the Afghan security forces. They also stressed that defending the country is the duty of all Afghan citizens,” a presidential spokesman Latif Mahmoud said.
Some politicians showed their support to a move to mobilize public uprising forces against the Taliban, saying it will prove effective in boosting unity in the fight against the group. However, they expressed their concern over a lack of healthy management of the resistance forces.
“The move by the government for public mobilization is good, but the practical framework should be reviewed. The public forces should follow guerrilla warfare,” said Abdul Hafiz Mansour, a member of the negotiating team of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.
“Herat is a role model. The consensus in Herat for supporting the Republic, the security and defense forces is there, and this has boosted the morale,” Herat governor Abdul Saboor Qani said. “We hope that the Herat-like consensus is implemented across Afghanistan.”
The political leaders also discussed the size of the public uprising forces in Monday’s session.
This comes as five provincial capitals have fallen to the Taliban while heavy fighting has gripped other capital cities in various parts of the country.

Acting Finance Minister Leaves Country: Sources

The acting minister of finance, Khalid Payinda, has left the country due to pressure by the Presidential Palace, sources said, adding that he is not expected to return to Afghanistan. 
The Ministry of Finance did not comment on the matter but a letter by the ministry shows that Khalid Payinda has left the country for an official visit and Alam Shah Ibrahimi, the deputy minister of finance for customs, is caretaking the ministry. 
 “There are some people around the president who are trying to install their favorites in the Ministry of Finance,” said Zalmay Noori, a member of the finance and budget committee of the Wolesi Jirga, the Lower House of Parliament. 
 A letter seen by TOLOnews shows that Payinda asked two days ago to leave the country, asking his deputy to be appointed as acting minister. 
 “Appointments in the Ministry of Finance and many positions that have income and are areas for corruption, they have been organized deeply and have had a serious effect on the country’s economy,” said Arif Rahmani, an MP. 
 A private sector representative said Payinda, who was appointed to the post seven months ago, has left the country as nine main ports – income generating border towns – have fallen to the Taliban, resulting in a 50% decrease in government revenue. 
 “Six ports, some of them are key, have been lost. Torkham, Hairatan, Ghulam Khan and Angor Ada are still under government control,” said Khan Jan Alokozay, the deputy head of the Afghanistan Chambers Federation.
 The Ministry of Finance and the Presidential Palace did not comment on the matter. Some MPs said that political moves in the appointment of acting ministers and full-fledged ministers at the Ministry of Finance led to the decrease in government revenue before it was affected by the fall of border towns to the Taliban.

The Afghan National Security and Defense Forces (ANDSF) pushed back a Taliban offensive on Mazar-e-Sharif city and retook Nahr-e-Shahi district, Balkh governor Mohammad Farhad Azimi said on Tuesday.
Azimi said that on Monday night the ANDSF and the Taliban clashed in Nahr-e-Shahi district and Dehdadi district.
He said the Taliban retreated from the area after facing strong resistance from the Afghan security forces.
“The Taliban have focused their attention on Balkh province to take control,” said Azimi.
“We managed to recapture this area while facing strong resistance and with the help of air support,” said Sultan Musavi, the police chief of Nahr-e-Shahi.
Nahr-e-Shahidi is adjacent to Mazar-e-Sharif, the center of Balkh.
“Our frontline crosses over 34 kilometers which is very vulnerable,” said Abdul Kabir Sharifi, Nahr-e-Shahi district governor.
“Last night we were attacked, but we defeated the Taliban,” said Abdul Qadeer, the commander of public uprising forces.
Meanwhile, a number of residents of Hazarjereeb village in Dehdadi said that the Taliban has fired mortars toward the 209 Shaheen Army Corps several times in the past few days.
“Mortars were fired from the Imam Bakri direction towards 209 Shaheen Army Corps, the people are very fearful and they are fleeing the area,” said Nawid, a resident in Dehdadi.

The recent spate of violence has displaced between 20,000 and 30,000 people in the south of Afghanistan, particularly in Kandahar province, which has seen heavy fighting in recent months, according to government officials and elders.
 There are also many families who have been displaced in the provinces of Farah, Badghis and Helmand.
There are accounts from some displaced families of the Taliban killing or abducting their men. However, the Taliban rejected these claims as propaganda of the intelligence agencies of the Afghan government.
Displaced families now lack food, shelter and health services.
Haji Camp is one area holding displaced families.
Bas Bibi is a displaced person who lost five children in a Taliban attack in the outskirts of Kandahar city. Now she has the responsibility of feeding an 18-member family.
“I don’t have anything here, I want help,” said Bakh Bibi, a war IDP.
Belqis is another displaced person in the same refugee camp in Kandahar. She said that twenty days ago the Taliban attacked her house and murdered her son in front of her eyes.
The government gives them food once a day.
Medics and health workers are providing other essential aid voluntarily.
“I told them (the Taliban) that I have been devastated, I had only one son, they (Taliban) asked me to give my daughter-in-law to them to marry, so we escaped at midnight,” said Bilqis, a war IDP in Kandahar.
“There are hundreds of pregnant women among them, they may give birth to the child at any moment, but there are no health services to help them here or to take them to hospitals,” said Sabawoon, a doctor in Kandahar.
Shukria, in the same refugee camp, says that the Taliban arrested her husband 20 days ago in Spin Boldak. He was earning only 4000 Afs per month as a watchman.
“I have seven children, they are asking about their father, how can I bring back their father?” said Shukria.
“The Taliban have done no work for the people, nor have they built a bridge or provided drinking water, they killed our youth and our young women became widows,” said Nadia, a war IDP.
According to the refugee department, the total number of people displaced in Kandahar is estimated at 20,000 families. But local elders have said that the number is more than 30,000.
From 17 districts in Kandahar, only Takhtapol district is under government control. The Taliban have also captured some parts of Kandahar city.

Afghan security agencies are not providing information about developments on the frontlines in the north.

13 Children En Route to Terrorist Training Rescued: MoJ
","
The Afghan Ministry of Justice said on Tuesday that the country's intelligence forces prevented 13 Afghan children from being taken to Pakistan and trained to be terrorists.
According to the ministry, terrorists intended to take the children to the Khyber Agency in Pakistan's Balochistan province to provide them terrorism training after deceiving their families, but the Afghan security forces prevented it from happening.
""Our country is in a state of war, in a state of - unfortunately - obvious aggression; when a society is in a state of war, its obvious that calamities and catastrophes are widespread as well,"" said Justice Minister Fazel Ahmad Manawi.
The radicalization of children in Pakistani religious schools is a constant concern for Afghan leaders and regional and international analysts.
The Ministry of Refugees and Repatriations stated that another 67 children who were being smuggled by human traffickers and migrants out of the country in border areas between Iran and Afghanistan were detained by Iranian border guards and handed over to Afghan security forces.
Zabiullah Rahmatzadeh, director of immigration at the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriations, said: “These people were going to Iran from Nimroz via Zahedan; fortunately, we handed them back to their families.”
Numbers provided by the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriations show that in the last four months more than 70 people, including six women and three children who were about to be taken out of the country by human traffickers, have been rescued by Afghan police forces.
Zahir Farahi, the Interior Ministry's director of the human trafficking department, said: “They had made fake visas, photo-changed passports, fake passports, and generally fake ID cards for them, and they wanted to get them out illegally either through the air or across open borders.”
Members of the Afghan government's High Commission to Combat Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants held a conference on Monday to discuss the US State Department's recent report on human trafficking.
According to the US State Department’s report, Afghanistan is among the 17 countries that have failed to meet the minimum standards set for the prevention of human trafficking.
The State Department has warned that the 17 countries’ efforts in fighting human trafficking have been insufficient and unsatisfying and this could lead to sanctions by the United States against these countries.

He said that the Taliban will face the same fate as their commander Mawlavi Fazel did in 2001.
The warning comes as several provincial capitals have fallen to the Taliban in the past week.
“The Taliban came to the north, but they were trapped. But this time, with the support of the God, it will be difficult for them to get out of the north—for instance, what Mullah Fazel faced here, they will face the same fate,” said Dostum in Mazar-e-Sharif.

“He (Ashraf Ghani) should find my father, I don’t want my husband from Dostum and Ashraf Ghani, I don’t want my children, but they should find my father,” said Zeba. “Would you tolerate it if this situation happened to you?” asked Zeba, adressing the political leaders.
“Give us shelter, give us a place to live. Everything has been allocated for us, but nothing has been delivered to us so far,” said Qadria, a displaced person in Kabul.
Some displaced people in Kabul said they will die if food is not delivered to them.
“Since we arrived here--so far we have had no food or place to live, we got a tent with a lot of difficulty,” said Fatima, a displaced person.

1000 Inmates Freed as Taliban Opens Prisons in Captured Cities
","
The Taliban has released over 1,000 prisoners from jails after the group's recent takeover of six cities in the past few days, officials from the directorate of the prison administration said on Wednesday.
Officials said that high-profile prisoners who were accused of threats against national security had been transferred from the jails before the Taliban’s takeover.
However, numbers gathered by TOLOnews indicate that up to 1000 prisoners were released just from Kunduz city in Kunduz province and Zaranj in Nimroz, and that 200 of these were Taliban.
“May they (Taliban) live long, they broke open the prison,” said an inmate in Farah.
“Most of them were sentenced on criminal charges--drug smuggling, kidnapping and armed robbery,” said Safiullah Jalalzai, director of the prison administration.
Based on TOLOnews’ numbers, 630 prisoners in Kunduz--among them 13 women and three foreigners--were released from the jail by the Taliban. Of that figure, 180 were Taliban fighters including 15 high-profile Taliban inmates who had been sentenced to death by the Afghan government. 
Most of the inmates had been arrested by the Afghan security forces in the past six years.
200 inmates accused of murder were also released by the Taliban in Kunduz.
Statistics show that 140 security guards were providing security at the prison in Kunduz.
The Taliban attacked Kunduz for three consecutive days. Most of the attacks were originating from villages like Ibrahimkhel, which has a direct route to the prison. Four security force members were killed and four others were wounded during the attack on the prison in Kunduz.
Sources said that 350 prisoners were released by the Taliban in Zaranj city in Nimroz, including 40 Taliban inmates.
The Afghan government has stated that when the territories are recaptured, the prisoners will be arrested again.

Calls for Sanctions on Pakistan Dominate Afghan Social Media
","
Over the past four days, Afghan social media users have tweeted thousands of posts on Twitter and on other platforms using the hashtag #sanctiononpakistan, intending to draw the international community's attention to accusations of Pakistani support for the Taliban, which Pakistani officials deny. 
A social media expert said the hashtag “sanctiononpakistan” was the top Twitter trend in Afghanistan for the past four days and was the second most popular trend in Pakistan. Social media users from European countries and elsewhere also joined the campaign.
“The people can raise their voices through social media and bring the attention of the international community toward the Afghan people. This indicates that the people are not living in the past decades and they are defending their motherland,” said Negina Yari, a human rights activist.
“These hashtags are shared by the people, not bots,” said Fahim Ahmad Yousuzad, an IT expert, referring to automated social media accounts that can produce the illusion of a groundswell of broad public support for a particular message. 
Social media users expressed their hope that the trend will cause international sanctions to be imposed on Pakistan.
“The wounded members of the Taliban are being treated in Pakistan, their leaders live in Pakistan,” said Khaled, a resident in Kabul.
“If Pakistan’s support for terrorism does not stop, Pakistan will pose a threat to the entire world,” said Naser, a Kabul resident.

Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan Wrap Up Drills Near Afghanistan
","
Troops from Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan wrapped up their drills intended to simulate a joint response to potential security threats coming from Afghanistan, AP reported on Wednesday. 
The drills began last week involved 2,500 Russian, Tajik and Uzbek troops and about 500 military vehicles.
According to AP report, the drills that were held at Harb-Maidon firing range about 20 kilometers north of the Tajik border with Afghanistan, saw the troops practice action against invading militants. As part of the exercise, Russian Su-25 attack jets struck mock targets imitating militant vehicles. 
Quoted by AP, the Russian military said the maneuvers took place “against the background of the destabilization of the situation in neighboring Afghanistan, in order to work out the issues of repelling possible threats and practical interaction to ensure security and maintain stability in the Central Asian region.”
The Russian military said that Russian troops in Tajikistan practiced using new weapons during the drills, including new sniper rifles and flame throwers.
Russia has pledged to offer military assistance to its ally and other ex-Soviet Central Asian nations if they face incursions of militants from Afghanistan, AP reported. Three Central Asian nations — Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan — are members of the Moscow-dominated security pact of several ex-Soviet nations, the Collective Security Treaty Organization.
The drills in Tajikistan followed last week’s exercise in Uzbekistan that involved 1,500 Russian and Uzbek troops and 200 military vehicles. As part of the maneuvers, four Russian Tu-22M3 long-range bombers flew from their base in western Russia to strike mock militant camps at the Termez firing range in Uzbekistan near the border with Afghanistan. 
This comes amidst an increase in violence in various parts of Afghanistan, particularly northern provinces.

Khan: Taliban Will Not Talk to Govt 'As Long As Ghani Is There'
","
Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan said that the Taliban leaders have told him that until President Ghani is no longer in power, the group will not engage in talks with the Afghan government, Reuters reported on Wednesday. 
“The condition is that as long as Ashraf Ghani is there, we (the Taliban) are not going to talk to the Afghan government,” Khan said, quoting the Taliban leaders, according to the report. 
Representatives of a number of countries, including the US, are currently in the Qatari capital of Doha talking to both sides in a last-ditch push for a ceasefire. 
Khan said he tried to persuade Taliban leaders when they were visiting Pakistan to reach a settlement. 
A political settlement in Afghanistan was looking difficult under current conditions, Khan added. 
President Imran Khan also said that Washington has been pressing Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban to broker a peace deal as negotiations between the insurgents and Afghan government have stalled, and violence in Afghanistan has escalated sharply, according to Reuters. 
“Pakistan is just considered only to be useful in the context of somehow settling this mess which has been left behind after 20 years of trying to find a military solution when there was not one,” he said. 
The United States will pull out its military by Aug. 31, 20 years after toppling the Taliban government in 2001. But, as the United States leaves, the Taliban today controls more territory than at any point since then. 
Kabul and several Western governments say Pakistan’s support for the insurgent group allowed it to weather the war, said Reuters.  
The charge of supporting the Taliban despite being a US ally has long been a sore point between Washington and Islamabad.  
But Pakistan denies supporting the Taliban. 
“I think that the Americans have decided that India is their strategic partner now, and I think that’s why there’s a different way of treating Pakistan now,” Khan said. 
Pakistan and India are archrivals and have fought three wars. The two share frosty ties and currently have minimal diplomatic relations. 
The Republic's negotiating team in Doha led by Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, called on the international community, especially Troika meeting member states, to adopt serious measures to prevent Taliban attacks on cities, which “have led to war crimes"" and ""widespread human rights abuses,"" the Afghan Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued on Thursday.
Speaking at the ""Extended Troika Meeting"" with China, US, Russia and Pakistan, Abdullah stated that ""the Taliban's bloody attacks in collusion with regional and international terrorists"" will lead to a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" and will incite more terrorism in the region that will threaten the world. 
Abdullah stressed the need to start meaningful negotiations to establish an immediate ceasefire and to reach a political agreement, said the foreign ministry. 
On Thursday, the Afghan government handed a proposal to Taliban negotiators in Qatar offering a power-sharing deal in return for an end to fighting, according to a member of the government's team in Doha who asked not to be named, AFP reported.
But neither the Afghan government nor Taliban have yet commented on the proposal.

Under the US-Taliban peace deal signed in Doha in February 2020, the US committed to leave the country by May 1, but US President Joe Biden extended the pullout deadline to September 11, 2021, without conditions. 
“It was a surprising decision, but our reaction was that the US as a sovereign country takes its own sovereign decisions and it will have aftershocks,” said Wahid Omar, a top aide to Ghani.
With the announcement of Biden’s withdrawal plan, the US and NATO forces started withdrawing from their bases, including the Bagram airbase. The Taliban increased its attacks at this time. 
The Taliban now controls ten provincial centers and 200 districts.
According to Afghan government statistics, the war has now displaced over 190,000 people across Afghanistan.
Recently a UN report said that the level of civilian casualties has increased by 47 percent this year. The UN said that over 5,000 civilians have been killed and wounded during the first six months of 2021 due to the fighting.

US Sending 3,000 Troops to Afghanistan to Begin Evacuations
","
As the security situation worsens in the country, the United States plans to send an additional 3,000 troops to Afghanistan to assist with evacuation as the Taliban advances on Kabul.
Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said three battalions, one US Army and two Marine, will go to Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul where military transport planes would be waiting.
The Department of Defense is preparing to possibly evacuate the US embassy and US citizens in the capital of Kabul as the Biden administration considers the possibility that capital could fall within 30 days, administration and military officials have said, according to The New York Times.
The Taliban’s unexpectedly fast gains have led to the Defense Department speeding up its plans to get Americans out of Afghanistan.
“These forces are being deployed to support the orderly and safe reduction of civilian personnel at the request of the State Department,” Kirby said, as well as to accelerate the processing of applications for Special Immigrant Visas for Afghan translators and interpreters.
“We expect to drawdown to a core diplomatic presence in Afghanistan in the coming weeks,” Kirby said, adding that the United States will continue to engage in diplomacy with the Afghan government and people.
Officials say a possible evacuation would involve the forceful use of US military force to protect people as they’re taken to Hamid Karzai International Airport where military transport planes would be waiting.
Kirby said these new troops will have some defense equipment.
“They have some defense capabilities,” he said. “They will obviously have the capabilities they need to defend themselves.”
Kirby said the mission was “a very narrowly defined” and temporary mission and estimated there would be fewer than 1,000 troops.
Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke with President Ashraf Ghani “to stress that the United States remains invested in the security and stability of Afghanistan in the face of violence by the Taliban,” US State Department said.
Blinken and Austin “informed President Ghani that the US is reducing our civilian footprint in Kabul in light of the evolving security situation and will accelerate the tempo of Special Immigration Visa flights,” the statement said.

UNSC Discussing Condemnation of Taliban Attacks on Cities: Report
","
Quoting diplomats, Reuters reported on Friday that the UN Security Council is discussing a draft statement that would condemn Taliban attacks on cities and towns causing high civilian casualties and threaten sanctions for abuses and acts that risk Afghanistan's peace and stability.
The formal statement, drafted by Estonia and Norway and seen by Reuters, has to be agreed by consensus by the 15-member body, the report said.
According to Reuters, the text also “strongly affirms that the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is not recognized at the United Nations and declares that it does not and will not support the establishment of any government in Afghanistan imposed through military force or restoration of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.”
Meanwhile, Abdullah Abdullah, head of the High Council for National Reconciliation, said on Thursday that participants at an international meeting on Afghanistan in Doha agreed on the need to accelerate the Afghan peace process and call for an immediate end to the ongoing violence in the country.
He said that representatives and envoys of international and regional countries and members of the Expanded Troika in their meetings in Doha made it clear that the Afghan issue has no military solution, they shall not recognize any regime taking over by force and insisted on the acceleration of peace talks.
US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said that after two days of intense consultations and discussions with the Afghan negotiating teams, Qatar, as chair, issued a Chairman’s Statement on behalf of regional and international stakeholders.
“We demand an immediate end to attacks against cities, urge a political settlement, and warn that a government imposed by force will be a pariah state,” Khalilzad said.

Participants at an international meeting on Afghanistan in Doha agreed on the need to accelerate the Afghan peace process and call for an immediate end to the ongoing violence in the country, said Abdullah Abdullah, head of the High Council for National Reconciliation, who also attended the meeting. 
He said that representatives and envoys of international and regional countries and members of the Expanded Troika in their meetings in Doha made it clear that the Afghan issue has no military solution, they shall not recognize any regime taking over by force and insisted on the acceleration of peace talks.
The statement issued by the meeting urged the two parties to take steps to build confidence and accelerate efforts to reach a political settlement and a comprehensive ceasefire as soon as possible and called for an immediate cessation of violence and attacks in and on the capitals of other governorates and cities.
The participants reiterated that they will not recognize any government in Afghanistan that is imposed through force.
Participants took note of converging statements of both sides on the following guiding principles for a political settlement: inclusive governance; respect for human rights, including the rights of women and minorities; a mechanism to deliver a representative government, a commitment to not allow any individuals or groups to use the soil of Afghanistan to threaten the security of other countries; and respect for international law, including international humanitarian law.
The participants called on all Afghan sides to act in accordance with these principles and build on them in the future political settlement.
They raised grave concerns about reports from across Afghanistan with respect to continued violence, large numbers of civilian casualties and extra-judicial killings, widespread and credible allegations of human rights violations, all attacks (ground and air) against provincial capitals and cities, and the destruction of physical infrastructure that perpetuate conflict and make reconciliation efforts more difficult.
They reaffirmed that they will not recognize any government in Afghanistan that is imposed through the use of military force.
The participants committed to assisting in the reconstruction of Afghanistan once a viable political settlement is reached following good faith negotiations between the two sides.

Pakistani Forces Clash with Afghan Protesters in Spin Boldak

Pakistani forces clashed on Thursday with hundreds of Afghans stranded on Pakistan’s side of a commercially vital crossing point with Afghanistan after its closure by Taliban, Pakistani security officials said as quoted by Reuters.
The disturbances broke out after a 56-year-old Afghan traveler died of a heart attack as he waited in the dusty heat to enter Afghanistan via the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing, Arif Kakar, a Pakistani official on the scene, said as quoted by Reuters.
According to Reuters report, protesters carried his body to a local Pakistani government office demanding the border be reopened. Some began throwing stones at security forces, who responded by firing tear gas and charging the protesters with batons to disperse them. No injuries were reported.
The Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing is landlocked Afghanistan’s second busiest entry point and main commercial artery to the Pakistani seacoast.
Taliban captured Spin Boldak district last month. They announced the closure of the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing on Aug. 6 in protest at a Pakistani decision to end visa-free travel for Afghans.
The group is demanding Pakistan allow Afghans to cross the frontier with either an Afghan ID card or a Pakistani-issued refugee registration card.
According to Reuters, some 900 trucks went through the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing daily before the Taliban seized it.

Saleh Says Govt Will Continue Fight against Taliban
","
First Vice President Amrullah Saleh on Friday said the government will continue its fight against the Taliban by fully supporting the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces and the public uprising forces.  
Saleh said it was a key decision made by the government’s security meeting chaired by President Ghani. 
“In today’s meeting on national security chaired by President Ashraf Ghani, it was decided with conviction and resolve that we stand firm against Taliban terrorists and do everything to strengthen the national resistance by all means and ways,” Saleh said in a tweet. 
In another post, Saleh said that the Taliban will be defeated and that he will never surrender to the group. 
He did not provide details on the reasons behind the current situation in the country but said he will not bow to any deal named peace with the nature of surrender. 
“I will never accept Taliban domination on the people of Afghanistan under any deal that is dictated and imposed by Taliban,” Saleh added. 
But Taliban who overran at least 17 provincial capitals in the last week in a statement asked government officials to surrender to them and that they will be forgiven. 
Some politicians and lawmakers said that the current situation is due to the government’s “wrong policies.” 
“The Presidential Palace or presidential advisers and minister should explain the situation,” said Sayed Jawad Mohseni, a religious scholar. 
“Nowhere in the world, it is in a way that those who are responsible do not feel their responsibility towards the people and the government… and apply policies that do not favor national interests,” former vice president Ahmad Zia Massoud said.

UN Chief Seeks Immediate End to ‘Taliban Offensive’
","
The United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Friday asked the Taliban to immediately end its offensive and said seizing power through military forces is a losing proposition.
“I remind all parties of their obligation to protect civilians and I call on the Taliban to immediately end the offensive and return to the peace table,” Guterres said.
“Afghanistan is spinning out of control,” he said. “Every day, the conflict is taking a bigger toll on civilians, especially women and children.”
The UN chief said that in the last month alone, more than 1,000 people have been killed or injured from indiscriminate attacks against civilians, notably in Helmand, Kandahar and Herat provinces. 
“The fighting between the Taliban and Afghan security forces in urban environments is causing tremendous harm. I am also deeply disturbed by early indications that the Taliban are imposing severe restrictions on human rights in the areas under their control, particularly targeting women and journalists,” Guterres said.
He said that it is particularly horrifying and heartbreaking to see reports of the hard-won rights of Afghan girls and women being ripped away from them.
“The message from the international community to those on the warpath must be clear.  Seizing power through military force is a losing proposition. That can only lead to prolonged civil war or to the complete isolation of Afghanistan,” he added.
He called on all parties to take heed of the conflict's heavy toll and its devastating impact on civilians. “They all must do more to protect civilians,” he said.
‘This is the moment to halt the offensive,” the UN chief said. “This is the moment to start serious negotiation. This is the moment to avoid a prolonged civil war or the isolation of Afghanistan.”
This comes as the Taliban seized at least four provincial capitals in less than 24 hours on Thursday and Friday, including the city of Herat in western Afghanistan and Kandahar in the south.

Sweeping Conquests Challenge US Hopes of Better-behaved Taliban
","
Recent Taliban advances in Afghanistan are challenging the Biden administration’s hopes that a desire for international respect, and for international aid and cash, may moderate the group’s worst behaviors when the US ends its war in the South Asian country.
While showing interest in a diplomatic settlement, Taliban commanders have accelerated their battlefield advances ahead of the US military’s withdrawal at the end of August. The group has at least 17 provinces under its control.
Quoted by the Associated Press, rights groups have said that others have acted much like the brutal Taliban the US overthrew in 2001. That includes allegedly killing detainees en masse and demanding that communities provide them with females above age 15 to marry. A Taliban spokesman has denied the allegations.
Still, Biden administration officials have kept up the hopeful claim that a desire for international approval might influence Taliban actions. They reject criticism by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell R-Ky, who opposes the withdrawal and dismisses what he calls “diplomatic carrots,” the Associated Press reports.
“If the Taliban claim to want international legitimacy these actions are not going to get them the legitimacy they seek,’’ White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday as quoted by the Associated Press.
This comes after a meeting on Afghanistan’s peace in Doha last week. US special envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad also traveled to Qatar to make that point to Taliban officials directly. 
“We demand an immediate end to attacks against cities, urge a political settlement, and warn that a government imposed by force will be a pariah state,” Khalilzad said after the meeting.
Regardless of whether the Taliban heeds that warning, President Joe Biden is showing no sign of slowing or reversing a decision to withdraw from the war.
The United States is ending its nearly 20-year combat mission in Afghanistan on Aug. 31 under a deal that President Donald Trump signed with the Taliban in 2020. 
Only three countries – Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – recognized the Taliban regime back in late 1990s.
The United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Friday asked the Taliban to immediately end its offensive and said seizing power through military forces is a losing proposition.

US Lawmaker Seeks Immediate Air Support to Afghanistan
","
US Congressman Mike Waltz in a letter to President Joe Biden on Friday urged the Administration to take immediate steps to provide assistance to the Afghan people in their fight against the Taliban and make significant changes to their regional strategy.
He requested Biden to provide military resources to assist the Afghan National Security Forces including air support to blunt the Taliban offensive, immediately cut off aid to Pakistan and consider sanctions, and ask for Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad’s resignation “due to his catastrophic diplomatic strategy.”
“The Afghan Government and its people desperately need our help and I urge you to reverse course and provide military resources to assist the Afghan National Security Forces,” he wrote.
First, President Biden can crush the Taliban offensive by committing American air power to support the Afghan Army, Waltz wrote. The Taliban are in the open and exposed as they maneuver to surround Afghan cities. Just as we did in 2001, small groups of special forces partnered with the Air Force will make a dramatic impact and reverse the Taliban’s psychological narrative that victory is inevitable. 
Second, he wrote, Biden should send a very clear message to the Taliban’s backers in Pakistan that enough is enough. The Pakistani military is integral in the Taliban’s resurgence. At best, the Pakistanis are turning their backs and complicit in what’s happening.  At worst, they’re actively aiding and equipping the Taliban. The US must suspend all aid and consider sanctions on key military and intelligence officials. 
“Finally, Biden must shelve our feckless efforts to negotiate with brutal terrorists until the situation is stabilized militarily. The President should fire US Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad whose diplomatic strategy has failed spectacularly. Khalilzad convinced the last two administrations that the Taliban had changed, were interested in governing, and cared about diplomacy and peace,” the US congressman said in his letter. 
He said that it is not too late to reverse course to prevent complete Taliban control, Al-Qaeda resurgence, and an unraveling of all our investments from the last twenty years. 
“If you do not course correct now, Afghanistan could implode by the twentieth anniversary of September 11th. That will be a tragedy that will not only devastate the families and those who have sacrificed so much but the collective conscience of our country. America’s national security and credibility are at stake. The world is watching,” he concluded.
This comes as the Taliban seized at least four provincial capitals in less than 24 hours on Thursday and Friday, including the city of Herat in western Afghanistan and Kandahar in the south.

Canada to Accept 20,000 Vulnerable Afghans

Canada plans to resettle more than 20,000 vulnerable Afghans including women leaders, human rights workers and reporters to protect them from Taliban reprisals, Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino said on Friday.
Canada continues to be deeply concerned by the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan and the risks it poses for many vulnerable Afghans, the Canadian immigration office said in a statement. 
Canada will continue to implement the special immigration program for Afghans who contributed to Canada’s efforts in Afghanistan, the statement said.

“Offering refuge to the world’s most vulnerable speaks to who we are as Canadians, particularly in times of crisis. As more Afghan refugees continue to seek shelter in Canada, we’re redoubling our efforts to help 20,000 Afghan refugees—who remain vulnerable wherever they go—find safety here. The situation in Afghanistan is heartbreaking, and Canada will not stand idly by,” the minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship of Canada said.

Ghani, Political Leaders Agree to Form Team for Negotiations

Shortly after his pre-recorded message to the nation, President Ashraf Ghani held a consultative meeting with political and jihadi leaders who supported his notion for preventing further instability in the country, the Presidential Palace said. 
The participants of the meeting agreed to assign an authoritative team for negotiations to represent the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, the Palace said.
The statement did not elaborate on the nature of the responsibility that will be assigned to the team, but analysts said it might push further plans for overcoming the current situation by pushing plans of ceasefire and an interim setup.
Ahead of this meeting, a group of influential Afghan political leaders met behind closed doors for many hours in a meeting led by Chairman Abdullah Abdullah to discuss the country’s situation, ceasefire and a possible plan to establish an interim government, sources familiar with the matter said. 
Abdullah’s last week's visit to Doha was also discussed in the meeting, the sources said.

Many Kabul residents interviewed by TOLOnews on Saturday had mixed views on the country’s future. Some of them were optimistic about a better future while others said they have lost their hope. 
“Life is normal in Kabul when I see crowds everywhere. They should focus on provinces too. People are not in a good situation there,” said Enayat, a Kabul resident.

Biden Authorizes 1,000 More Troops to Help Afghanistan Departure
","
President Joe Biden authorized on Saturday an additional 1,000 American troops for deployment to Afghanistan, increasing to nearly 5,000 the number of US troops to ensure what Biden called an “orderly and safe drawdown” of American and allied personnel.
According to a White House statement, the plan also covers safe evacuation of Afghans who helped our troops during the US mission and those at special risk from the Taliban advance.
“Second, I have ordered our Armed Forces and our Intelligence Community to ensure that we will maintain the capability and the vigilance to address future terrorist threats from Afghanistan,” Biden said.
“Third, I have directed the Secretary of State to support President Ghani and other Afghan leaders as they seek to prevent further bloodshed and pursue a political settlement. Secretary Blinken will also engage with key regional stakeholders,” Biden said.
He said that the United States has conveyed to the Taliban representatives in Doha, via US Combatant Commander, that any action on their part on the ground in Afghanistan, that puts US personnel or their mission at risk there, will be met with a swift and strong US military response.
“I have placed Ambassador Tracey Jacobson in charge of a whole-of-government effort to process, transport, and relocate Afghan Special Immigrant Visa applicants and other Afghan allies. Our hearts go out to the brave Afghan men and women who are now at risk. We are working to evacuate thousands of those who helped our cause and their families,” he said.
Biden said that “one more year, or five more years, of US military presence would not have made a difference if the Afghan military cannot or will not hold its own country.”
“And an endless American presence in the middle of another country’s civil conflict was not acceptable to me,” he added.

Taliban Discussing Future Govt in Doha

The Taliban said discussions are underway in Doha about a future government, including its structure and name, and they are expected to report on the process in the very near future.
A high-ranking official of the Taliban told TOLOnews that their leadership is busy in discussions in Doha and is in contact with the international community and political parties within Afghanistan.
The Taliban’s political deputy leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar said that the current moment is a test for the Taliban.
“At this time we face a test because now we are responsible for the security of the people,” Baradar said.
On Monday the Taliban entered the TOLOnews compound in Kabul, checked the weapons of the security staff, collected government-issued weapons and agreed to keep the compound safe.
There was no improper treatment of staff members.
“There should be a government in which all people have a share and there should be stability,” said Ahmad Farid, a Kabul resident.
“Countrywide security should be ensured as the people are tired of the war,” said Fazl Rabi, a Kabul resident.
Hizb-e-Islami leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who is part of a self-proclaimed council to move the talks forward, said that Ashraf Ghani’s failures led to the current situation in the country.

Rapid Escape of Ghani, Afghan Leaders Harshly Criticized
","
The fleeing of former Afghan president Ashraf Ghani and his aides has been harshly criticized by Afghans who say Ghani played with the ""blood of the people"" and ""committed treason"" by abandoning his post after making pledges to stay. Other officials and political leaders were also taken to task for rapidly fleeing despite pledges to stay and fight to the end.
Outraged Afghans noted that Ashraf Ghani, his deputies, ex-NSA Hamdullah Mohib and other officials had repeatedly spoken of remaining in the country, but they left even before the end of the foreign forces' mission in Afghanistan. 
RIA news agency, quoting a Russian embassy official who in turn quoted witnesses, said that Ghani fled with four cars ""full of money"" and had to leave some money ""lying on the tarmac,"" Reuters reported, adding it ""could not independently confirm the veracity of his account immediately.""
As the fighting intensified, Ghani and his aides pledged they would remain in the country. Ghani during a speech two weeks ago even criticized the Afghan king Amanullah, who reigned in the 1920s, for leaving the country.
“Amanullah Khan is dear to me, you know it, but he escaped and left us alone. I will not escape,” Ghani said.
“They are welcome even if they come through force, but we will not leave,” Mohib said last month.
Some former politicians and leaders also publicly vowed not to leave, making pledges that they would fight to the end.   
“If my bullets are finished, if I am arrested and I have a weapon and our people are around us, no force will be able to take me alive. Martyrdom is my pride,” said Atta Mohammad Noor of Jamiat-e-Islami.
“I will see martyrdom as an honor and I will not leave this country,” said Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum, head of Junbish-e-Milli.
Afghans speaking to TOLOnews said that these leaders should not have done this to the people.
“The way they left the country was really hopeless,” said Wahidullah, a shopkeeper.
“They played with the people’s blood. The Taliban will face the same fate if they do the same,” said Khalil Rahman, a Kabul resident.
“Shame on a president who left this poor country like this and escaped,” said Abdul Hai, a Takhar resident. 
Sources said that 18 passenger flights from Afghanistan landed in Tajikistan and 28 landed in Uzbekistan on Sunday, most of which were filled with airport employees and government officials.
Data provided by sources indicates that 45 flights were made from Kabul to Tajikistan in the last two days.
“Those coward leaders left a country whose people sacrificed their lives for them,” Afghan ambassador in Tajikistan Zahir Aghbar said when welcoming a group of Afghans who left Kabul for Dushanbe. 
Reports indicate that an Afghan forces helicopter crash-landed in Uzbekistan, but more details are not yet available.
The Taliban has asked all government employees and politicians to not flee the country and has pledged their safety.

At Least 10 People Killed in Chaos at Kabul Airport
","
At least 10 people were killed in the chaos at Kabul airport after crowds of thousands flocked to the area on Sunday afternoon and into Monday with the hope of leaving the country. 
People entered the airport from all sides despite the presence of US forces as well as troops from other nations attempting to secure the evacuations of their respective citizens and Afghan local staff. 
Shots were fired and a stampede ensued, both of which caused fatalities. AFP, quoting the US Pentagon, reported that US forces killed two armed people. Two other people were killed after they fell from a US military airplane in flight after takeoff. The people had apparently grabbed onto the aircraft from the outside.  
Some eyewitnesses said that 10 were wounded.
Airport officials said that people were misinformed about available flights, and entered the area after all flights had stopped. Many of those present did not have passports.
In one video being shared widely on social media, scores of people ran alongside a large US military aircraft as it attempted to take off.
“People flocked to the airport out of fear, and unfortunately there are casualties,” said Ahmad Shah Katawazi, a former official. 
“This is the result of Ashraf Ghani’s wrong policies,” said Hamidullah Masroor, a university lecturer. 
“We have six members in our family, and we want to leave due to the uncertain situation,” said Mohammad Rabi, a Kabul resident.

UN Secretary General to Taliban: The World is Watching
","
UN Secretary General António Guterres in a speech to the Security Council on the ongoing situation in Afghanistan said that the international community expects the Taliban to respect international humanitarian law and the fundamental rights of the Afghans, particularly Afghan women and girls. He said there have been ""chilling reports"" of ""severe restrictions on human rights"" and accounts of ""mounting human rights violations"" against women and girls.
He said that the world is following events in Afghanistan with a ""heavy heart and deep disquiet about what lies ahead.""
“All of us have seen the images in real time. Chaos. Unrest. Uncertainty. And fear,” he said.
On the hopes of the new generation of Afghanistan, he said: “Much lies in the balance. The progress. The hope. The dreams of a generation of young Afghan women and girls, boys and men.   
The UN Secretary General urged all parties, especially the Taliban, to exercise ""utmost restraint"" to protect lives and to ensure that humanitarian needs can be met.
“I remind all parties of their obligation to protect civilians. I call on all parties to provide humanitarians with unimpeded access to deliver timely and life-saving services and aid,” said the UN chief.
“And I also urge all countries to be willing to receive Afghan refugees and refrain from any deportations. Now is the time to stand as one,” said the UN chief.
He said he was ""relieved to report"" that in ""large measure"" UN personnel and premises in Afghanistan have ""been respected,"" and urged the Taliban to continue to ""honor the integrity and inviolability of diplomatic envoys and premises.""
Guterres said that the international community must be united and ""speak with one voice to uphold human rights in Afghanistan.""
Speaking of Afghan women and girls, he said: ""They are looking to the international community for support--the same international community that assured them that opportunities would be expanded, education would be guaranteed, freedoms would spread and rights would be secured.""
Guterres said the ""international community must unite to make sure that Afghanistan is never again used as a platform or safe haven for terrorist organizations.""
The United Nations is committed to supporting Afghans, he said, adding that basic services must continue to be provided amid a humanitarian crisis affecting a large portion of the population. 
He noted that in a statement issued on Sunday the Taliban said that they ""would work with existing institutions,"" and the secretary general said it is ""crucial that civil servant salaries continue to be paid, infrastructure is maintained, airports are reopened, and health and education services continue."" 
""The United Nations presence will adapt to the security situation,"" he said, and ""above all, we will stay and deliver in support of the Afghan people in their hour of need.""
He called for an ""immediate end to violence, for the rights of all Afghans to be respected and for Afghanistan to comply with all international agreements to which it is a party.""
Guterres said ""the following days will be pivotal,"" and ""the world is watching.""

Biden 'Stands Squarely Behind Decision' for Afghan Pullout
","
US President Joe Biden, facing strong criticism within the US and abroad for his administration's handling of Afghan policy which facilitated the Taliban's rapid takeover of the country, made a televised statement on Monday in which he resolutely stood by his decision, although acknowledging he would be criticized for it. 
“I stand squarely behind my decision,” Biden said, adding that after 20 years he learned there is no ""good way to withdraw"" from Afghanistan.
Biden stated that the US's mission was not ""nation-building"" and that it had already achieved its objectives of killing Osama Bin Laden--mastermind of the 9/11 attacks--and preventing Afghanistan from becoming a future safe haven for terrorists. 
""I will not repeat the mistakes we have made in the past, of doubling down on a conflict that is not in the national interests of the United States. Those are mistakes that we cannot continue to repeat when we have significant interests around the world we cannot afford to ignore,"" said Biden. 
Biden indicated that the negotiations would not have borne fruit if extended indefinitely while still US soldiers would have been committed to fighting. 
""The political leaders of Afghanistan were unable to come together for the good of their people... while the chips were done. They would never have done so when US forces were in the country"" fighting for them, he said. 
""It is wrong to order American troops to step up when Afghanistan's own armed forces would not,"" he said. 
Biden acknowledged the slow pace of evacuations from Afghanistan earlier this summer. ""Some of the Afghans did not want to leave earlier... It was also in part because the Afghan government discouraged us from organizing a mass exodus, to avoid triggering a crisis of confidence.""

Watchdog Calls On US to Protect Afghan Journalists
","
The United States must do more to ensure the safety of Afghan journalists as the country falls under the control of the Taliban, including facilitating safe passage out of the country and providing emergency visas, the Committee to Protect Journalists said on Tuesday.  
The international organization said it is deeply concerned for the safety of hundreds of local journalists and media workers who could be targeted by the emerging Taliban regime.  
“The United States has a special responsibility to Afghan journalists who created a thriving and vibrant information space and covered events in their country for international media,” said CPJ Executive Director Joel Simon. “The Biden administration can and should do all within its power to protect press freedom and stand up for the rights of the vulnerable Afghan reporters, photographers, and media workers.” 
The committee said it has registered and vetted the cases of nearly 300 journalists who are attempting to reach safety, and there are hundreds more whose cases are under review. Because of the deteriorating security situation at the airport, only a handful have been able to board a flight to the US or a third country where their visa requests can begin being processed. The vast majority of threatened journalists remain in hiding. 
Afghan journalists working with The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal have been unable to board a flight out of the country, the Post reported today. In a joint statement sent to President Biden, the news outlets called on the US to do more to guarantee safe passage out of the country for journalists and media workers who have supported their news operations. 
“The international community’s understanding of what is happening in Afghanistan will depend on the survival of what was once a thriving independent press, even if much of the reporting takes place from exile,” Simon continued. “The local knowledge of Afghan journalists cannot be replaced.” 
The committee said it has long advocated globally for emergency visas for journalists at risk precisely to avoid temporary or improvised responses when new threats emerge. 
To date, CPJ has registered and vetted 45 high priority cases of Afghan journalists in which the threat from the Taliban is clear and imminent. Many are female journalists whose record of reporting on women’s rights has exacerbated the risk.
