6,Biden Says US Will Disrupt Any Threat from Afghanistan | TOLOnews,"US President Joe Biden in a statement on 10th anniversary of raid that killed Osama bin Laden said that the United States will remain vigilant about the threat from terrorist groups that have metastasized around the world.
“As we bring to an end America’s longest war and draw down the last of our troops from Afghanistan, al Qaeda is greatly degraded there,"" Biden said. “But the United States will remain vigilant about the threat from terrorist groups that have metastasized around the world. We will continue to monitor and disrupt any threat to us that emerges from Afghanistan.”
He said that ten years ago, he joined President Obama and members of US national security team to ""watch as our military delivered long-awaited justice to Osama bin Laden.”
“It is a moment I will never forget—the intelligence professionals who had painstakingly tracked him down; the clarity and conviction of President Obama in making the call; the courage and skill of our team on the ground,” he said.
“It had been almost ten years since our nation was attacked on 9/11 and we went to war in Afghanistan, pursuing al Qaeda and its leaders. We followed bin Laden to the gates of hell—and we got him. We kept the promise to all those who lost loved ones on 9/11: that we would never forget those we had lost, and that the United States will never waver in our commitment to prevent another attack on our homeland and to keep the American people safe,” he added.
Al-Qaeda not 'completely' uprooted in Afghanistan
The Afghan government says that the roots of the network are still alive in Afghanistan and the group still poses a threat to the country and the world and is collaborating with the Taliban.
But the Taliban has rejected any type of relations with al-Qaeda.
The US presence in Afghanistan over the last 20 years was due to the existence of al-Qaeda. Biden last month said the US has achieved its objectives in the Afghanistan war.
“Right now, al-Qaeda and Talib are not two different ideologic topics; they are beyond that as they have intermarried within their families,” NDS chief Ahmad Zia Saraj said last week.
The question that arises is how can al-Qaeda pose a threat to Afghanistan and the world while its leader was killed ten years back?
“Al-Qaeda was not owned by bin Laden,” said Atiqullah Amarkhil, a former military officer. “Al-Qaeda is still active in Afghanistan and anyone who says that we have eliminated al-Qaeda--they are lying.”
The Afghan government sees the Taliban’s ties with al-Qaeda as a key challenge in the way of the peace process.
“Even though the Taliban has agreed with the US to cut ties with al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups, al-Qaeda is still fighting among the Taliban,” said Rahmatullah Andar, spokesman for National Security Council.
Meanwhile, Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, said Saturday the often-fractured Afghan political leadership must unify in its peace talks with the Taliban or risk more bitter fighting as the US and NATO withdraws, AP reported.

109,MoI Arrests Mediators Helping Hand Over ANDSF Outposts to Taliban | TOLOnews,"Elders--or others--who act as mediators to negotiate between government forces and the Taliban-- causing security force members to abandon their posts--have been arrested, the Ministry of Interior Affairs (MoI) said on Sunday.  The ministry reiterated that cooperation with “terrorists” is unacceptable.
Many districts have recently fallen to the Taliban or have been evacuated after being under siege. Sources confirmed the fall of at least 20 distrits' centers to the Taliban in the last two months.
Over the last 24 hours, security forces evacuated Saghar district in Ghor, Arghandab district in Zabul and Posht Rod and Lash districts in Farah, bringing the total to 23.
Security agencies said that government forces have either shifted the centers of the districts or they have made tactical retreats. The Taliban has claimed to have captured these districts.
“There were clashes in Posht Rod district last night during which the police headquarters fell to militants,” said Dadullah Qane, head of the Farah provincial council.
“We lost our security forces and youth, and the wounded are in critical condition,” said Anisa Ghayur, a member of Ghor's provincial council.
The Taliban claimed on Sunday to have captured the center of Arghandab district in Zabul and two markets in Ali Abad district in Kunduz.
However, security forces said the Khashrod district in Nimroz was retaken hours after it fell to the Taliban.
“Security outposts were attacked by the enemy in Khan Abad and Ali Abad districts. So far, the security and defense forces have responded strongly,” said Inamuddin Rahmani, spokesman for the Kunduz police.
The Ministry of Interior Affairs said that security forces have been directed to arrest those who attempt to mediate between government forces and the Taliban to hand over security forces outposts. 
“The reason that soldiers leave their outposts is that they are faced with the lack of facilities, equipment and personnel,” said Shogufa Nawrozi, an MP from Helmand.
Clashes have been reported in at least 20 provinces over 70 districts, according to sources and officials.
Footage obtained by TOLOnews shows some soldiers in Lash wa Joyan district in Farah province, apparently pleading for help.
The Ministry of Defense responded by pledging that the security forces will receive support when they need it.
“The enemy has suffered its highest casualties in Nimroz, Badghis and Helmand provinces,” Defense Ministry spokesman Rohullah Ahmadzai said.
Local security officials in Ghazni and Takhar on Sunday said security forces had progressed in the two provinces and that the Taliban suffered “heavy casualties” during their operations.

316,Samangan’s Center Aybak Falls to Taliban | TOLOnews,"The city of Aybak, the capital of the northern province of Samangan, fell to the Taliban on Monday, MPs confirmed.
With Aybak, the number of cities that fell to the Taliban recently has risen to five. Zarang, capital of Nimruz, Sheberghan, capital of Jawzjan province, Taloqan, capital of Takhar, Sar-e-Pul, capital of Sar-e-Pul province and now Aybak, capital of Samangan, are the cities that are under Taliban control.
The residents of Aybak accused the central government of negligence.
MPs from Samangan in Parliament said that the security forces left the city without fighting.
“Unfortunately, Aybak, the city in Samangan, fell to the Taliban today about 2:30pm (local time). The government forces retreated from the city and now the Taliban has entered and captured the police HQ and the National Directorate of Security (NDS) building,” said Abdalelah Mohammadi, an MP from Samangan.
In recent days the Taliban intensified their attacks in the northern parts of the country, especially in Jawzjan, Samangan, Takhar, Balkh, Kunduz and Sar-e-Pul provinces.
Taloqan fell to the Taliban late Sunday after weeks of fighting with security forces and public uprising forces.
Local officials said hundreds of the security forces retreated from Taloqan and moved to Farkhar and Warsaj districts in the province and have retaken the two districts from the Taliban.
“Takhar has been at war for the past 40 days and witnessed heavy clashes…. The people are concerned about the situation and most of the people have left their homes and moved to other provinces,” said Faramarz Amiri, a resident of Takhar.
Ramazan, another resident of Takhar, said: “The security forces and public uprising forces have been fighting for  the past 40 days and standing against the Taliban without the support of the central government. Unfortunately, the lack of equipment and central government’s support has caused Taloqan to fall to the Taliban.”
In Kunduz city, clashes have been ongoing between the security forces and the Taliban for the past two days.
Despite the loss of the provincial governor's office, police HQ and NDS building, the government forces are still fighting the Taliban close to the 217 Pamir Corps and airport.
“Clashes are ongoing in Kunduz city close to the remaining government buildings,” said Mohammad Yousuf Ayoubi, head of the provincial council of Kunduz.
Officials of the Parliament's defense commission have urged the government to take immediate action against the Taliban’s advance, saying: “If immediate action does not take place, other cities will also fall to the Taliban.”
But the security organizations are assuring the people that the cities will be retaken.
Currently, the Taliban has increased pressure on Faizabad city, capital of the northeastern province of Badakhshan; Maimana, capital of Faryab; Pul-e-Khumri in Baghlan and Mazar-e-Sharif, capital of Balkh province.
The Afghan security forces pushed back a Taliban attack in the Dehdadi district of Balkh, the Defense Ministry said on Monday, adding: “The Taliban left the area after suffering heavy casualties.”
The Taliban claim, however, their fighters clashed with security forces in the Kod-e-Barq area and govt forces sustained casualties.
The National Army's 209 Shaheen Corps, which is one of the security forces' largest military bases, is also located in the district.
Dehdadi borders Mazar e Sharif city.
“The enemies attacks are ongoing in Kunduz, Sheberghan, Samangan and Sar-e-Pul but the government forces are standing against them and we also have made progress in Kunduz and other cities. The enemies have suffered heavy casualties” said Mirwais Stankezai, a spokesman for Interior Ministry.
The security organization on Monday announced that 579 Taliban were killed, and 161 others were wounded in the past 24 hours in operations mounted by security forces. But the Taliban has not yet commented on casualties.

75,Taliban Accuses US of Seeking Regional Bases Post-Withdrawal | TOLOnews,"Taliban in a new statement has accused the United States of seeking a military presence in the region, “especially in Pakistan,” as part of its efforts to maintain surveillance in Afghanistan, warning that it will lead to “more bloodshed” in the country if it takes place.
The statement published on Friday says that the Doha agreement has been “repeatedly” violated by the US and that it has led to the continuation of violence in Afghanistan. The US has rejected claims on violation of the Doha agreement.
Taliban says that some media reports have said that the US will keep its presence along the Durand Line for surveillance using Pakistan’s territory and airspace. This will mean that the US will maintain its presence in Bagram and Shindand—bases in Afghanistan—and that if this happens, the Taliban “will continue their jihad” as in the past, the statement says.
The Taliban has asked Pakistan not to facilitate the continuation of “Afghanistan’s occupation;” otherwise, if it happened, it will be “a mistake” and a “big blunder” for Pakistan.
However, Pakistan has ruled out the possibility of allowing the US to operate a military base or conduct drone operations in Afghanistan from its soil. 
On May 26, Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told Pakistan’s Senate that there are no such arrangements with Washington, Islamabad's longtime ally in the so-called war against terrorism.
“Let this House and the Pakistani nation be a witness to my testimony that under Prime Minister Imran Khan, there will be no American base on Pakistani soil,” Qureshi said as quoted by Anadolu Agency.
The Pentagon this week insisted the US commitment to the region is not wavering.
“Just because we are removing our troops and ending our military mission in Afghanistan doesn’t mean that we’re walking away from the region,” Pentagon Spokesman John Kirby told reporters on May 24. “Nothing could be further from the truth,” he said.
According to an AP report, last week Gen. Frank McKenzie, the commander of US Central Command, said negotiations with Afghanistan’s neighbors for overflight rights and troop basing are “moving forward” but will take time.
On May 24, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with Pakistan's chief of Army staff, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa. The Pentagon didn’t provide further information about what the two military leaders discussed, other than to say they talked about “shared regional interests and objectives.”
“During the call, Secretary Austin reiterated his appreciation for Pakistan’s support for Afghanistan Peace Negotiations and expressed his desire to continue to build on the US – Pakistan bilateral relationship,” the Defense Department said.
Commanders have said they will monitor threats from “over the horizon,” to ensure that terrorists cannot again use Afghanistan as a base to launch attacks against the US. But they have acknowledged that the US does not yet have any agreements for basing or overflights from any of the neighboring countries.
“There’s still going to be a robust United States presence in the Middle East, in the Central Command area of responsibility,” Kirby said on May 24. “There’s absolutely going to be no diminution of our commitment to our allies and partners in the region.”
The US and coalition forces started withdrawing from the country on May 1. Some bases have been handed over to Afghan forces. US forces have started scrapping equipment that can neither be repaired nor handed over to Afghan forces in its current state. The scrapping of vehicles and other equipment is taking place at the country’s largest airbase, the Bagram Airfield.
The new statement by the Taliban comes days after their previous statement in which they did not name Pakistan but warned against any attempt to establish foreign bases in the region. 
US Central Command announced on Tuesday that they estimate the US withdrawal from Afghanistan to be somewhere between 16% and 25% complete.
Approximately 160 C-17 loads of material and equipment have left Afghanistan, the US Department of Defense (DoD) reported, and more than 10,000 pieces of military equipment have been turned over to the Defense Logistics Agency. 
US-controlled installations in Afghanistan are also being returned to the Afghan Defense Ministry, and so far, five installations have been handed back, said the Defense Department.

According to local officials, 10 houses and 80 shops were also damaged in the attack.
“Unfortunately, the district building was totally damaged--100 percent--while the police HQ building was also damaged 80 percent,” said Mohammad Younus Stanekzai, the Balkh district governor.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the deadly attack.

Musavi painted a grim picture of the attack's aftermath.
“Administrative affairs have been suspended for two days,” said Stanekzai.
Eyewitnesses said that the majority of those killed in the blast were civilians.
“No one is visiting the city and bazaar, they are all afraid,” said Abdul Karim, a resident in Balkh.
The security agencies have so far not commented on how a truck full of explosives managed to reach such a highly secure area.
“Our personnel have been deployed in the area, there is no need to feel fear, everyone can return to their work,” said Zia-ul-Haq Toofan, the commander of the Balkh district police.

103,‘Govt Controls Less Than Half of Territory in Balkh District’ | TOLOnews,"At least 35% of the territory in Balkh district in the northern province of Balkh is under the government’s control while the remaining parts are either under Taliban influence or are contested between the two sides, an official said.
Balkh district has 184 villages, district governor Mohammad Yunus Stanekzai said, adding that 65 of them are under the government’s control.
The district has 180 members of public uprising forces who have a big role in ensuring the security of the district, Stanekzai said.
Balkh district is 24 kilometers far from Mazar-e-Sharif city, the center of Balkh, and is known as one of the most insecure districts in the province. The district has witnessed two big attacks in the last two months: one on an army base and another on police headquarters.
The district governor said that the public uprising forces need further support in terms of equipment.
“Balkh district has 184 districts. Unfortunately, most of the villages are under the opposition’s influence, but fortunately, we have a good percentage under our control where the morale is very high… At least 35% of the villages are under the government’s control.”
At least 20 members of public uprising forces are stationed at an outpost 4 kilometers far from Boka district, which is often contested between government forces and the Taliban. Security forces at the outpost said they are always ready to defend their areas against any threat from militants.
“Taliban attack whenever they find an opportunity, but we are fully ready to defend,” said Agha Mohammad, a commander of public uprising forces.
Another member of the public uprising forces said that clashes have intensified over the last few days.
“This area is called Piaaz-Kar. It is the frontline. The enemy roams here every night, but they have failed in their evil goal. They attack, but they are suppressed, they are defeated and then they go back,” said Hafizullah, a member of public uprising forces.
According to the local forces, the Taliban uses people’s homes for the war, a claim that was rejected by the group.
“These homes have been used in many attacks on us. They have shelled rockets on us from these homes, but they cannot succeed. We have given them a tit-for-tat response and we will do the same, going forward,” said Gulab Khan, a public uprising forces member.
The continuation of clashes in the district has created concerns among the resident who says violence must stop.
“The foreigners are leaving our country, but still attacks are happening in our district in which only civilians are harmed,” said Saifuddin, a Balkh resident.
“They destroyed houses, killed our people, and left them with a dark future, they planted mines. What is the sin of these Muslims? They are civilians,” said Abdul Jabbar, a Balkh resident.

A week ago Noor pledged to mobilize the public in Balkh against the Taliban and to clear the province and restore stability. 
“God forbid, the fall of Balkh means the fall of the north and the fall of the north means the fall of Afghanistan. We have experienced this. It is not a story, it is history,” Noor said. “We will not allow it to fall. We are here with a firm commitment to return security to the people, and we will not leave them alone.”

The Taliban took over Kohistanat district in Sar-e-Pul province a few years ago.
“What should the people expect from this approach? The people think there might be a deal behind the scenes, they think that the government in a sense wants to arm the Taliban and give territory to the Taliban,” said MP Sayed Hayatullah Alimi.
In addition, there are reports that several checkpoints have fallen to the Taliban in the Sayedabad district of Maidan Wardak province.
Meanwhile, the Afghan Ministry of Defense said that the security forces will change the current security situation.
“The present situation will not continue in this shape. The Afghan security forces will be deployed in all those areas where the Taliban have infiltrated and conducted terrorist attacks against the people, the security forces will prevent terrorist attacks by the Taliban,” said Fawad Aman, deputy spokesman at the Ministry of Defense.

139,‘Delay in Reinforcements Major Reason Behind Fall of Districts’ | TOLOnews,"Military experts and sources have reported that delays in deploying reinforcements to districts – most of which are in rural areas – have been a major cause behind the fall of district centers to the Taliban in the last two months.
Sources in some provinces said that the exaggeration by the Taliban about the number of their fighters and about the expansion of their attacks on other districts is another reason behind the evacuation of districts without any resistance.
On Monday sources said that at least a dozen districts fell to the Taliban. In the past 48 hours, the centers of five districts fell to the group. In many cases, the security forces did not receive reinforcements and evacuated after hours of fighting, locals and other sources said. The districts include Sholgara, Dawlat Abad and Kushinda in Balkh province.
“Many areas are falling to the armed opposition because security forces remain under siege and they have no equipment or supplies,” said Raihana Sadat, a member of the provincial council in Balkh.
On Sunday, at least 600 security force members in Dasht-e-Archi district in Kunduz retreated to Khawaja Bahauddin District in Takhar, according to sources. Later during the same day, Qala-e-Zal district in Kunduz was also evacuated by security forces.
“The Imam Sahib district will also fall if the situation continues,” said Khaluddin Hakimi, a member of the Kunduz provincial council.
In Faryab, meanwhile, in addition to the fall of six districts to the Taliban, fighting has inched closer to the capital, Maimana. MPs from the province said the lack of reinforcements has led to the crisis in the province.
However, the Defense Ministry on Monday said that reinforcements have been sent to Maimana.
“It is questionable,” said Sayed Anwar Rasul Oghli, head of a youth movement in Kabul. “People know that the security forces stationed in Qaisar, Dawlat Abad, Shirin Tagab and Khwaja Sabz Posh (districts) retreated without any resistance.”
“We had at least 300 people. Many of them fought and said they were faced with an offensive attack. They did not know the number (of the Taliban), but it was exaggerated, and they were told that at least 5,000 to 6,000 Taliban were attacking them,” said Fawzia Raufi, an MP from Faryab.
The Defense Ministry also said that all options are on the table to improve the security situation.
“You witnessed the clearance of many areas in Takhar last night,” Defense Ministry spokesman Rohullah Ahmdzai said.
“I am ready. It is not only Qaisar (district)… I am ready to go to Faryab, to Jawzjan, or any other place that has fallen, even areas that are too challenging. I am ready to go and respond to the Talibs,” said Nizamuddin Qaisari, former police chief for Qaisar district in Faryab.
Figures collected by TOLOnews show that at least 50 districts have fallen to the Taliban or have been evacuated in the last two months. Many of these districts are still contested and have seen ongoing fighting over the last few weeks.

Operations are underway to retake other districts that are under Taliban control, the MoD said.
It was also reported that the Taliban has captured the center of Kandahar’s Khakriz district and Logar's Baraki Barak district in the last 24 hours.
Fighting is raging between government forces and the Taliban in many provinces of the country, and the escalation of fighting around the provincial capitals of Ghazni, Kunduz, Baghlan, Takhar, Faryab, and Maidan Wardak provinces is causing alarm among residents and members of Parliament.
Clashes between government forces and the Taliban have been ongoing for several weeks in many parts of the center of Kunduz province and the fighting has displaced hundreds of families.
“The Taliban are on one side of the war and the government is the other side. We do not know where to take shelter,” said Zarmeena, a Kunduz resident displaced by the fighting. “We do not have electricity, food or water,” she said.
Gol Mohammad, another displaced person in Kunduz, said: “Everything has become tougher for us, we do not have food or water.”
Kunduz MPs are calling for serious action to repel Taliban attacks in Kunduz and to address the problems of the displaced people.
“Clashes are going on inside Kunduz city. If serious and timely actions are not taken, I assure you that the Kunduz city, for the third time, will get closer to the brink of collapse,” said Nilofar Jalali Kofi, an MP from Kunduz.
Meanwhile, the prolonged fighting in provincial centers Maimana in Faryab, Taluqan in Takhar, Maidan Shahr in Maidan Wardak, and Ghazni city in Ghazni have caused MPs to raise the alarm in Kabul.
Amir Mohammad Khaksar, an MP from Takhar, stated: “Violence has soared in the country, if it continues, I don’t think we will reach a sustainable peace in the country.”
Government forces on the front lines in the Shinwari district of Parwan province say they are attempting to retake lost districts and to expel the Taliban from the province.
“In the next one or two days we will arrive in Seya Gerd district in Ghurband Valley,” said Sharifullah, an army officer in the Shinwari district in Parwan.
Fawad Aman, the Deputy Spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, said: “Advances have been made in Balkh, Takhar, Baghlan, and Kunduz provinces and this will continue in other parts of the country as well.”
Today President Ghani in a video conference with governors and provincial police chiefs called the Taliban attacks a crime against human rights and stressed that military and civilian officials must abide by human rights laws.

165,People Take Up Arms in Two More Provinces to Fight Taliban | TOLOnews,"Like eight other provinces across Afghanistan, this time, a large group of residents of Herat in the west and Kunduz in the north took up arms to support the Afghan defense and security forces in the fight against the Taliban.
Those who rallied in support of Afghan forces have said that they believe in peace, but will defend the democratic values at any cost.
So far, hundreds of people have taken up arms against the Taliban in Takhar, Balkh, Badghis, Baghlan, Nangarhar, Laghman, Jawzjan, Samangan and Kapisa provinces.
“The security forces are not alone. We are with them,” said Nazir Ahmad, a member of public uprising forces in Herat.
“We must serve the country. We are very tired. Our bridges are destroyed. Our schools are destroyed,” said Zikrullah, a member of public uprising forces in Herat.
Also in Kunduz province, a large number of people took up arms to support the Afghan forces in the fight against the militants.
“If you are fleeing Kunduz today, I want to tell you that a man dies one time, but a weak person dies each day,” said Rabbani Rabbani, member of Kunduz provincial council, referring to reports that some local officials had fled Kunduz following increased attacks by the Taliban.
People in northern Baghlan province have also taken up arms to fight the Taliban.
“The war is not the solution for conflict in Afghanistan. There is a good opportunity for the Taliban to agree on peace,” said MP Azim Mohseni.
Afghan security officials said that the government will never support the existence of militia forces, however all those who have taken up arms will be operating within the structure of Afghan forces.
The acting minister of interior Gen. Abdul Sattar Mirzakwal said that the government will add another 30,000 personnel to the ranks of the Afghan Local Police (ALP) and those who have taken up arms to fight will operate within the structure of the local police.
“We do not support building militia and will not allow it to happen. 30,000 people have been approved to serve in our military structure,” Mirzakwal said.
“The way this process has stared indicates a sign of danger,” said Rahmatullah Nabil, former head of the National Directorate of Security.
Referring to the recent waves of public uprising campaigns in several regions of Afghanistan, a Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid has said that these moves are part of the government's attempts.

168,Five Districts Fall to Taliban in 24 Hours | TOLOnews,"Five districts have fallen to the Taliban in the last 24 hours, including Shor Tapa in Balkh, Chak and Sayed Abad in Maidan Wardak, Rustaq in Takhar and Arghistan in Kandahar, adding another layer of complexity to the alarming situation that has emerged following the fall of territory to the militant group.
Takhar lawmakers in Parliament said Rustaq is the 13th district in the northeastern province that has fallen to the Taliban in recent weeks.
“The Shirkhan border town is fully under Taliban control. Reports indicate that Aqina border town has also collapsed and Ai Khanum town, that shares a border with Tajikistan in Dasht-e-Qala district, is also under threat,” said Hamiduddin Yuldash, an MP from Takhar.
The fall of strategic districts in the north, south and west has created concerns over the possible infiltration of Taliban into the income-generating territory in the country, including the Shirkhan town in Kunduz on the border with Tajikistan.
Kunduz's provincial council and a private sector entity said that they are concerned about the loss of Shirkhan's incomes to the Taliban and warned of threats posed to other border towns – the Aqina border town in Faryab and Ai Khanum in Takhar.
“Security problems have increased recently. Sometimes the customs department and the finance ministry tries to transfer its employees from one place to another,” said Hujjat Fazli, the CEO of Harakat, an entity facilitating investment opportunities for the private sector.
“We ask the government to pay serious attention to Shirkhan border town, to retake it,” said Khaluddin Hakimi, a member of the Kunduz provincial council.
Meanwhile, Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum, former vice president, warned the Taliban that he will return to Jawzjan in the near future and will suppress the Taliban after consultation with the president.
“I will begin my work. I will suppress them. I am calling on the security forces to come to me when I arrive,” Dostum told TOLOnews.
The deputy minister of interior for policy, Naqibullah Fayiq, said that the Taliban’s focus is on income-generating areas, including border towns, but pledged that these areas will be cleared of the group.
He said that 11 districts have been retaken from the Taliban in the last three days.
Figures collected by TOLOnews indicate that 108 districts have fallen to the Taliban in the last two months, but security forces have retaken 10 of the districts during this period.

170,"Dostum Vows to Return to North, Suppress Taliban | TOLOnews","Former vice president Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum, who is in Turkey for treatment, said Sunday he will soon return to his home province of Jawzjan in northern Afghanistan to suppress the Taliban in the north, after consultation with President Ghani and the Defense Ministry.
“I predicted this years ago,” Dostum said, referring to Taliban offensives in northern provinces. “All districts, tanks were handed over to the Taliban without resistance. I don’t know what the plan is?”
He said that the reason behind the fall of the districts should be investigated.
“We have seen such issues many times. I was telling them that such a situation will come and I asked Mr. President to assign someone capable because even your security guard will not remain beside you the next day,” Dostum said. “Now that such a situation has come, we will come to the north, it is our home, I have been raised there… I will be proud if I am killed and martyred there.”  
Dostum called on the security forces and public uprising members to not surrender to the Taliban and to continue fighting against the group. 
“I will never leave the territory,” he pledged, saying that he will definitely return. 
This comes as the Taliban has intensified their offensives against Afghan forces on multiple fronts. So far over the last two months, over 100 districts have fallen to the group. 
Five districts have fallen to the Taliban in the last 24 hours, including Shor Tapa in Balkh, Chak and Sayed Abad in Maidan Wardak, Rustaq in Takhar and Arghistan in Kandahar, adding another layer of complexity to the alarming situation that has emerged following the fall of territory to the militant group.

One of these attacks in the Block Ha area in Pul-e-Khumri continued for three hours, commando forces said.

Public uprising forces commanders in the provinces said they will stand beside the security forces to retake the lost districts. Some politicians said that it is necessary that people have taken up arms to defend the country under the current circumstances. 
In Takhar, the Taliban has attacked at least 10 districts. Now some residents have taken up arms to support the fight against the Taliban in preparation for potential attacks in Namak Ab, Rustaq and Kalafgan districts in the province. 
“The former mujahideen commanders, security forces, the police chief, the security chief, the governor, all were here and deployed people to various areas,” said Gen. Najibullah Najib, a former mujahideen commander. 
“We will never allow the Punjabis, the puppets, to threaten this country,” said Abdul Bashir, the deputy commander of a special forces unit in Takhar. 
Officials in Takhar said that government institutions in Rustaq, Kalafgan, Worsaj, Farkhar and the city of Taluqan have fallen to the Taliban. 
“You see that we are on the frontlines. Mr. Saadat and the commander of the highway is also here,” said Abdul Khalil Zahid, a commander of public uprising forces. 
“We are now in the Chashma-e-Shir frontline (in Takhar). It is not concerning. All Takhar people have been mobilized and are standing with security forces” said Habibullah Mahboob, a Takhar resident. 
Meanwhile, Balkh governor Farhad Azimi said that former mujahideen commanders have been mobilized to fight against the Taliban in the province following the fall of the centers of five districts of Balkh to the group. 
“Thousands of forces have been prepared to defend the city of Mazar-e-Sharif, the outskirts of Mazar-e-Sharif and the districts that have been lost,” Azimi said.  
A former mujahideen commander said that handing over districts to the Taliban is not acceptable and that they are fully ready to support the Afghan forces. 
“The move by Badghis residents is a self-motivated action and the main goal is to defend the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the security forces,” said Abdul Basir Salangi, an MP from Badghis. 
“We fought against the Taliban for years. I assure you that we will prevent the Taliban from recent disturbances in a few days,” said Mohammad Amin Dara-e-Soofi, a former mujahideen commander in Balkh. 
“We have enough special forces members in Jamshidi and Chai Khan area (in Balkh),” the Afghan Army’s recruitment officer Sayed Yasin Sadad said. 
The back-to-back fall of districts to the Taliban in the last two months has been unprecedented. Most of the districts that have fallen to the Taliban have been in the north.

They said that currently they are engaged in fighting on the frontlines with the Taliban, stating that they await permission from the government to launch offensives against the group.
TOLOnews’ correspondent Sayed Mohammad Aref Musavi, who reported from Afghania village in Nahr-e-Shahi district on the frontlines, said that hundreds of public uprising forces have deployed in the area to repel a possible comeback by the Taliban.
“We battled the Taliban for 15 days, our martyrs and wounded people remained there, but we never evacuated our checkpoints,” said Abdullah, a commander of public uprising forces in Balkh.

The women said that the historical record of the five years of the Taliban regime proved that the group violates women’s rights.
Thousands of people have taken up arms in support of the Afghan forces as the fall of districts to the group continues.
“They are standing by their brothers and are supporting the system, the people, and the country’s sovereignty,” a Ghor resident said.
The exact number of those who have taken up arms against the Taliban is so far not clear. The defense and interior ministries said that these forces will eventually be combined with the local police, NDS local forces, and the local army forces. 
“A situation that will later create bad consequences will not be allowed. They will first support us and then they will be included in the police, army or the local NDS forces,” the acting minister of interior Gen. Abdul Sattar Mirzakwal said.
Atta Mohammad Noor, who leads a public mobilization movement in Balkh and has gone to Balkh districts to fight the Taliban, criticized some government officials for not cooperating with them in their campaign against the group.
“We hear some words from some sides asking why have they gone to the war? They should stay in the city and hand over the war to us. My brother, you are losing the war,” Noor said.
Meanwhile, the office of Ahmad Massoud, a public figure and son of the national hero Ahmad Shah Massoud, said that former mujahideen leaders are making efforts to reorganize a new front against the Taliban by consulting political leaders from the former resistance front.
“We hope that this front is announced and the public uprising forces become organized,” said Saleh Mohammad Registani, a member of Ahmad Massoud’s political office.
There are questions about the achievements of the public uprising forces, but representatives of these forces said they have succeeded in preventing the fall of their towns to the Taliban.
“They have proved effective in defending the security belts on the outskirts of Kunduz city,” said Rabbani Rabbani, a member of the Kunduz provincial council.
“So far, we have not seen proper support by the government for the people,” said Abdul Basir Osmani, an MP from Badghis.

312,Key Areas in 2 Northern Afghan Cities Fall Amid Clashes | TOLOnews,"Central parts of the city of Sar-e-Pul and many areas in Kunduz city have fallen to the Taliban after heavy clashes between the two sides.  
Reports indicate that in Sar-e-Pul the governor’s compound, the police headquarters and the NDS office have fallen to the Taliban.  
Local officials said that security forces are stationed in an army base in Sar-e-Pul and in Balkhab district of Sar-e-Pul, as well as in two areas in Kunduz. Other areas have fallen to the Taliban. 
Taliban attacks on these two northern cities intensified over the last 24 hours after the Taliban took Sheberghan, the provincial capital in Jawzjan.
“The only remaining area is held by a regiment in the center of Sar-e-Pul province and (another) in Balkhab district,” said Behzad Haidarizada, a Sar-e-Pul resident.
“The central and local governments have paid no attention. The security forces did not even have food while they were under siege,” said Yar Mohammad Maihanparast, the head of the Sar-e-Pul residents' council in Kabul.
Some lawmakers from Sar-e-Pul said the government’s inattention led to the fall of the city and the loss of dozens of large pieces of military equipment to the Taliban.
“The inefficient officials in Sar-e-Pul made the situation worse and provided the grounds for collapse. I believe that Sar-e-Pul collapsed due to a deal,” said Sayed Hayatullah Alemi, an MP from Sar-e-Pul.
Videos from Kunduz show people fleeing their houses to avoid firing from either side. The videos also show bodies lying on the road in the city of Kunduz.
The Taliban released videos showing they had overrun the main roundabout in the center of Kunduz city, an area that was taken over by the group two times in 2015 and 2016.
The governor’s compound, the police headquarters and the NDS office in Kunduz have all fallen to the Taliban. Fighting has intensified on Kunduz streets, sources said.
“The security agencies, especially the Defense Ministry, paid no attention and did not provide support,” said Nilofar Jalali Kofi, an MP from Kunduz.
But security forces pledged that they will defend the city of Kunduz and its residents against Taliban attacks.
“The enemy suffered heavy casualties in areas they were attempting to capture,” said Haji Mohammad, the commander of the 2nd regiment of commando troops in Kunduz.
“Efforts are underway to make the situation normal in those provinces,” said Defense Ministry spokesman Fawad Aman.
Lawmakers from Sar-e-Pul and Kunduz warned that neighboring cities of the two provinces will also fall to the Taliban if the government does not pay the required attention to protect northern areas.

The centers of Charkh district in Logar, Burka district in Baghlan and Nerkh district in Maidan Wardak fell to the Taliban weeks ago. 
“In order to deploy our forces in areas where our troops made a tactical retreat, there is a proper military plan. We will be redeployed in those areas with more power and the enemy will not be allowed to grow,” said Rohullah Ahmadzai, spokesman for Defense Ministry. 
A lawmaker from Baghlan said that after fall of the Burka district in the province, clashes have reached the outskirts of the city of Pul-e-Khumri. 
“Baghlan needs serious attention as it is an important province,” said Asadullah Shahbaz, an MP from Baghlan. “This is because it is a connecting point for nine northern provinces. If it faces a problem, nine provinces will face the problem.” 
“The government should have the feeling that when it loses one place, it should retake it. Or it should maintain that place primarily and it should review its decision about those places that have been lost,” said Mohibullah Zaheer, a military affairs analyst. 
Meanwhile, Second Vice President Sarwar Danesh blamed the Taliban for making excuses in the peace process.

The clashes in the two provinces have intensified after the three-day ceasefire on May 13 to May 15.
The center of Dawlatshah district in Laghman fell to the Taliban on Friday.
Laghman residents said the Taliban presence will expand in the province if the government does not provide the required attention. 
Figures indicate that at least 10 civilians and armed forces were killed due to fighting in the last 24 hours.
Afghan Army Chief Gen. Yasin Zia visited Laghman on Saturday along with other security officials, but sources from the province said a military base and two outposts were evacuated by security forces in the Ganjoon area on the outskirts of the city of Mehtarlam, the provincial center, and some forces have surrendered to the Taliban.
“The fighting is 200 meters from Mehtarlam city. So far, there is no plan by the government to clear Laghman’s districts,” said Sahib Noor Qaderi, a Laghman resident.
“One outpost in the Maidani area fell to militants. It collapsed after being under siege for three days,” said Gul Marai Laghmani, a senator.
In Baghlan, clashes are underway in four of its districts as well as on the outskirts of Pul-e-Khumri, the provincial center.
“Efforts are underway to ensure a ceasefire between the government and the opposition in Baghlan-e-Markazi (district),” said Nasim Mudabir, an MP from Baghlan. “In fact, if the central government or the local government proposes such a plan to the central government, there will be a disaster.”
According to figures by security agencies, clashes are underway in at least 20 provinces, including near their centers. The government launched operations to retake Charkh district in Logar, the Burka district in Baghlan, Dawlat Shah in Laghman, and Narkh and Jalrez in Maidan Wardak, but these operations have not succeeded in clearing out Taliban fighters.
“A proper and inclusive plan for security agencies is lacking. Sporadic fighting serves the enemy,” said Sayed Muqadam Amin, a military affairs analyst.
However, Defense Ministry spokesman Rohullah Ahmadzai said there is a proper plan by security and defense agencies to improve the security situation in the mentioned areas.
“Heavy losses have been inflicted on our enemy during our operations every 24 hours, but we advance with precision to avoid harm to civilians,” said Ahmadzai.
In Badakhshan province in northeastern Afghanistan six security force members were killed and four more were wounded in Taliban attack on an outpost in Darayem district. Moreover, two people, including a religious scholar, were killed in an attack by unidentified armed men in Parwan.
“The enemy is trying to disrupt our security. It has started its targeted attacks,” said Aminullah Shakoori, head of Parwan's Provincial Council.
The Defense Ministry on Sunday said that at least 90 Taliban were killed and 45 more were wounded in clashes and defensive operations by Afghan forces in Logar, Maidan Wardak, Zabul, Herat, Farah, Faryab, Jawzjan, Helmand, Baghlan, Takhar and Kabul provinces in the last 24 hours.

258,Residents Claim Taliban Killed 5 People in Kabul District | TOLOnews,"Residents of Shakar Dara district, north of Kabul city, claim that five people--four security force members and a police hospital employee--were taken by the Taliban and then killed by the group.
The residents said the incident occurred in Haji Paik village in Shakar Dara on Friday night as the Taliban conducted a two-hour search operation on a street in the village.
Some relatives of the victims said the five young men were first tortured by the Taliban and then killed.
The residents called it a crime against humanity and blamed the government for not providing security.
Many residents of the province were not prepared to talk on the record about the incident, but one of them, Humayun, said: “They were four or five who didn’t have military uniforms. They were taken far from here.”
Many family members of the victims were not ready to speak on the record about the incident. But a relative of one of the victims gave an account:
“They took out my cousin’s eyes with a ramrod, they also took out his tongue and ran over him with a car. He was also hit by bullets from his toes to his head,” said Abdul Rahman, a cousin of one of the victims.
Mayil Agha, a resident of the area, said the Taliban interrogated him on Friday night. He said the group set up a checkpoint in the village and for two hours they searched for government-related individuals to abduct.
“They were here from 7:30pm or 8:00pm to 10pm. No one was here to help. They killed five people today and they might take five more the next day. What should we do and where should we go?” said Mayil Agha.
Sayed Kamaluddin, an army member, and his brother Sayed Bahiruddin, who was a police solider in Zabul; Niaz Mohammad, a police officer; Ramish, a member of police special unit; and Sayid Rahim, an employee at a police hospital who had a monthly salary of 6,000 Afs (almost $80) and was the only breadwinner for his family, were the five individuals who were killed in the incident.
“They are strangers. They martyred their brothers under Pakistan’s order,” said Nadir, a Shakar Dara resident.
Among close family members of those killed in the incident, only an uncle of Sayed Rahim spoke on the record about what happened on Friday night in their village.
“Four or five bullets hit his forehead. And some were in his backbone. He lied on the ground in Dasht-e-Gul Dara area,” he said.
“The Taliban has some roots in Shakar Dara. A strong base has been established for Talibs here, and from here they can operate in the Kohdaman area and even in the city of Kabul,” said Lotfullah Quraishi, a former commander of public uprising forces.
Residents of the village said that security forces last night searched the houses affected by the incident, instead of going after the Taliban.
“The Taliban are stationed on the other side of the river. Why are you searching for them here?” said Mohammad Shakir, a resident of Haji Paik village.
“The perpetrators of the incident will be arrested soon,” Shakar Dara district governor Gawhar Khan Baburi said.
A Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said the incident is under investigation. He said security force members will not be safe unless they quit fighting.

263,Afghans Who Worked for US Govt Face ‘Increasing Threats’ | TOLOnews,"Interpreters and other Afghans who worked for the US government over the last 20 years said they are concerned about “increasing threats” against their lives as the American and coalition troops are leaving the country.
Some of them said that despite promises by Western countries, it is not known when they will be out of the country.
The United States, Canada and some other countries have vowed to evacuate Afghans who worked with them during the last 20 years.
Some of these Afghans who did not want to speak on the record said they and their family members are faced with serious threats.
One of them, Abdullah Wali, said one of his former colleagues was taken by anti-government armed men 40 days ago and there has been no news about him to date.
“What will our fate be? They made some pledges… but nothing has been done so far,” Wali said.
Another young man, who is a resident of Shakar Dara district in Kabul province, said he has left his home due to threats and is living in Kabul city.
“My family is in Shakar Dara district but I cannot go to the district. I live here and I have rented a room,” said Massoud, an Afghan who worked with US forces in Kabul.
Meanwhile, some Afghans who worked with the UK government gathered in Kabul and said they want to secure safety for themselves.
“We worked with them and now we are left on our own,” said Asadullah, a former employee of the UK embassy in Kabul.
“They vowed to take us with them. They took many of our colleagues, but left us with an unknown fate,” said Mohammad Haroon, a former employee of the UK embassy in Kabul.
So far, the US has provided special immigration visas to 73,000 Afghans and has vowed to expedite this process.

43,Afghanistan: Ceasefire Violations Reported on 2nd Day of Truce | TOLOnews,"Officials on Friday reported ceasefire violations by the Taliban in at least two provinces in which as many as three soldiers were killed and a few more were wounded.
Uruzgan governor Mohammad Omar Shirzad said that the Taliban ""violated"" ceasefire in two places in the province today in which some security force members have been killed and wounded.
“One of the incidents happened in Kandahar-Uruzgan highway in which Taliban opened fire on security forces convoy in which we some were wounded and one was martyred,” he said. “Another attack by Taliban happened on Shaheed Amrullah Base in Tarinkot city, the center of Uruzgan, in which one soldier was martyred and one was wounded.”
Meanwhile, one army soldier was killed and three more were wounded in a roadside bomb blast in Tagab district, Kapisa province, at around 11:30 am on Friday, the provincial police spokesman Shayiq Shorish said.
He said the blast was followed by a gunfight between “army forces and Taliban.”
“These violations have happened in several areas by groups that operate under Taliban command because they do not obey their leader in action and this indicates Taliban’s weakness,” Defense Ministry spokesman Rohullah Ahmadzai said.
A Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that the allegations by the government were baseless.
The ceasefire was started on Thursday and will end on Saturday. Calls have grown on Taliban by the international community, Afghan political leaders and the people to extend the ceasefire after Eid al-Fitr. 
But the first day of ceasefire witnessed two blasts in Kandahar and Kunduz in which nine people were killed.
On Friday, the second day of the ceasefire, at least 12 people were killed and 15 more were wounded in an explosion inside a mosque in Shakar Dara district north of Kabul, according to a statement by Kabul police.
The blast happened at Haji Bakhshi Mosque in Qala-e-Murad Bek area in Shakardara district of Kabul during Friday prayer, police said.
Police said that Mufti Numan, the imam of the mosque, was also killed in the explosion.
No group so far has claimed responsibility for the explosion.
Taliban in a statement denied involvement in the attack. 
Survivors Recall Ordeal
“We were busy in the prayers when the explosion happened,” a survivor Ashiqullah said. “The target was the imam himself.""
“They are the enemies of religious scholars. These infidels do not bear mercy even on the people and the religious scholars,” said Mir Agha, an eyewitness.
“They can destroy Islam through committing such acts,” said Mawlana Abdul Saboor, a religious scholar. 
The incident happened few days after multiple blasts near a girls’ school in western Kabul that left over 80 people dead and 150 more wounded.
Taliban denied involvement in both attacks.
“There were large crowds of Muslims. I was also there in the row. A huge blast occurred and people dispersed around,” said a survivor of the mosque attack.
“The misery of our nation is that we do not know our foe and friends,” said Farid, a Kabul resident.

“Narai district fell (to the Taliban) without resistance. This shows the weakness of the leadership of the security agencies,” said Jawed Safi, an MP from Kunar.
Officials also reported fighting between government forces and the Taliban in Chahar Dara district in the northern province of Kunduz.
Officials in Parwan said that Taliban attacks were pushed back in some areas on the outskirts of Charikar city.

Security forces left Nijrab district in Kapisa – 100 kilometers north of Kabul – a week ago. Some MPs from Kapisa said that dozens of public uprising forces have taken up arms against the Taliban but so far the district has not been cleared.
“We should admit that there were some issues among the public uprising forces from the past and I hope that going forward, these problems are solved,” said Mir Afzal Haidari, head of the Parliament's defense commission.
In Takhar province in northeastern Afghanistan 16 districts fell to the Taliban two weeks ago and clashes are still underway on the outskirts of Taluqan city, the provincial capital.
“We should hit the enemy. Who is this enemy? A few Pakistanis? Or few other foreigners? Or a few Taliban? We have a strong force,” said Abdul Latif Omari, a border forces commander in Takhar.
The Ministry of Defense said that efforts are underway to retake the fallen areas. The ministry added that 170 Taliban fighters were killed in the last 24 hours.
“Our forces are in better positions. Areas under the Taliban will become more limited every day,” said Fawad Aman, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry.

“Dawlatshah district has been faced with a tough security situation over the last seven months and there has been no attention to it,” said Mohammad Farooq Watanyar, a resident of Laghman. 
In Helmand, meanwhile, Afghan forces launched operations on the outskirts of Lashkargah city and Nahre Saraj district in which at least 20 Taliban were killed, the Defense Ministry said. 
“There are clashes in Nawa district. There were sporadic attacks on an outpost on the outskirts of Lashkargah city. Now, the fighting has escalated. We expected the ceasefire to continue,” said Ataullah Afghan, head of the Helmand provincial council. 
According to information provided by security agencies, 18 provinces witnessed ceasefire violations by the Taliban from May 13 to May 15. 
But a Taliban spokesman denied violating the ceasefire but said that some bombs that were placed before the ceasefire detonated and caused casualties. 
“The Taliban’s ‘terrorist’ activities continued during the three days of ceasefire in which 21 civilians were martyred and 33 more were wounded,” said Fawad Aman, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense. “Their terrorist activities continued after the ceasefire.”  
Kabul residents said there is a need for a greater focus on peace efforts and a permanent ceasefire in the country. 
“The negotiations will lead to a result if there is a continued ceasefire,” said Hassan Khan, a Kabul resident. 
“War is not the solution. People want to live in peace and stability,” said Jamil, a Kabul resident. 
Meanwhile, President Ghani has ordered military commanders to conduct operations against the Taliban if they continue violence operations
“Nothing has been achieved or will be achieved by violence. If they think that they will win militarily, they have calculated wrong. Afghan people will never surrender,” said Basir Osmani, an MP from Badghis.

128,As Clashes Continue MoD Claims Heavy Toll on Taliban | TOLOnews,"Clashes were reported in 13 provinces in the last 24 hours with security forces evacuating two districts in the north while retaking control of one district in the south on Thursday night.
The Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that 258 Taliban were killed in security forces operations in Nangarhar, Laghman, Paktia, Zabul, Herat, Farah, Ghor, Faryab, Balkh, Jawzjan, Helmand, Takhar and Baghlan provinces in the last 24 hours.  
Taliban has rejected the figures.
The security forces evacuated from the center of Shirin Tagab district in Faryab and Dahana-e-Ghori district in Baghlan. The Defense Ministry said that security forces retook the control of Gereshk district in Helmand.
Moreover, an Afghan National Army base was fallen to the Taliban in Maidan Shahr, the center of Maidan Wardak province, a source said.
A base was fallen to the Taliban in Qala-e-Kah district in Farah province on Thursday evening.
The Taliban launched attacks on Qala-e-Kah district in the last two days, sources said, adding that at least eight security force members were killed in the clashes.
“There is the possibility that the city of Maimana (in Faryab) and Khawja Sabzposh district (in Faryab) will fall to the Taliban; therefore, there is a need for air support,” an MP Shafiqa Sakha Youlchi said.
“The Shirin Tagab district has been under siege for three years,” said Sibghatullah Silab, the deputy head of the Faryab provincial council. “The district will fall to Taliban due to lack of supply and weaponry.”
According to Faryab provincial council, several military vehicles and equipment were seized by the Taliban in Shirin Tagab.
Defense Ministry spokesman Rohullah Ahmadzai said that operations have had progress in some of the areas that were evacuated by security forces.
Violence has intensified following the start of the withdrawal of US and coalition forces from Afghanistan. A parliamentary committee on Thursday reported fighting on 200 fronts across the country in just a day. Moreover, at least 30 districts have fallen to the Taliban in the last two months. 
The negotiations in Doha have stalled after the announcement of the withdrawal of US and coalition forces by President Biden. The negotiating teams from the Afghan Republic and the Taliban held a meeting later this week, discussing ways to hold future meetings, but the high level of violence has diminished hopes for progress in the negotiations. 
Moreover, top Pentagon officials on Thursday said that militant groups like al Qaeda could pose a threat from Afghanistan to the United States and American allies in two years after the full withdrawal of international troops from the country.

“The attacks will increase but they will not achieve anything because they will increase people’s hate toward Taliban activities,” said former Afghan intelligence chief Rahmatullah Nabil. 
Ataullah Afghan, head of Helmand's provincial council, said the province has witnessed heavy clashes between security forces and the Taliban in the last two days, in which eight soldiers have died and 20 more have been wounded.

140,MPs Seek Formation of Public Front to Fight Taliban | TOLOnews,"The new wave of violence engulfing the country--now especially in the north--compelled some lawmakers on Monday to call for the formation of a ""high council of combat"" led by various prominent leaders from around the country as well as politicians in order to fight the Taliban.
The lawmakers said the government has lost control of managing the war and to defend the country the government should mobilize influential mujahideen leaders and public uprising forces.
The speaker of Parliament and some lawmakers emphasized the importance of a national consensus under the current situation and said the government should consider the value and participation of all ethnic groups when it comes to appointments in security agencies.
“There were forces, there were arms, and there was morale, but the morale was killed, unfortunately,” said Fazl Karim Aimaq, an MP from Kunduz.
“The government should be asked why districts have been handed over without resistance,” said Belqis Roshan, an MP from Farah.
“The government has unfair views toward the people and regions. Another reason (behind the fall of the districts) is the removal of experienced figures from the system,” said Habiba Danesh, an MP from Takhar.
The legislators stressed the need for a national mobilization against the Taliban.
“The Taliban offensive, the launch of a psychological war and the complication of the internal crisis have made us deeply concerned,” said Mir Rahman Rahmani, the parliament speaker.
“Six districts belonged to the first regiment. The commander is not there,” said Razi Mangal, an MP from Paktia.
“Our shallow leaders should manage the war, they are outside the country as the people are killed,” said Sadiq Qaderi an MP from Herat.
According to MPs, the support of neighboring countries for the Taliban is one of the reasons behind an escalation of violence in the country.
“There are countries that want to cause Afghanistan’s system to collapse so they can divide it into different countries and merge it with their own country,” said Shinkai Karokhil, an MP from Kabul.
“Pakistan wants to keep the war here fueled and wants to continue this proxy war,” said Nasir Farahi, an MP from Farah.
The government said that new plans are have been formed to boost security. The reshuffling of positions in the security agencies is said to have been part of this plan.

266,Pakistan Reopens Spin Boldak Crossing Held by Taliban | TOLOnews,"Pakistan reopened southwestern the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing in Kandahar province that is currently held by the Taliban, Pakistani customs officials said, as quoted by Reuters. 
The Pakistani government has allowed over 100 trucks carrying goods to cross into Afghanistan, the report said. 
The crossing has remained closed by Pakistan since fierce fighting for control of the Spin Boldak district erupted between Afghan government and the Taliban earlier this month. 
""Pakistan has opened its border with Afghanistan at Chaman today and resumed Afghan Transit Trade which was suspended since the last one month,"" Arif Kakar, a senior official of the Chaman pass said as quoted by Reuters. 
He said it would remain open six days a week.
The Afghan government has not yet commented on the move. 
The Finance Ministry on Monday said the Afghan government has lost 2.7 billion Afs (over $33 million) in customs revenue over the last four weeks as key border towns have fallen to the Taliban during this period. 
Over the past month, the government has lost control of key border towns including Islam Qala in Herat, Abu Nasr Farahi in Farah, Spin Boldak in Kandahar, Ai Khanum in Takhar, Dand Patan in Paktia and Shirkhan in Kunduz province.
The Finance Ministry said that the government has no control over seven customs departments in border towns. 
The Islam Qala customs area is one of the biggest trade gateways between Afghanistan and Iran and has been under Taliban control for the last 20 days. 
Rafi Tabe, a spokesman for the Ministry of Finance, said the collections from Jawza (May 22 to June 22, 2021) was 7.3 billion (at least $91 million) but this was reduced to 4.6 billion Afs ($57 million) in Saratan (June 23 to July 23). 
“The customs revenue is dependent on trading. It will have a negative impact on revenue if there are issues in trading,” he said. 
Private sector representatives said the issues around the border towns have affected traders’ willingness to import goods to the country through these gateways. 
Investors suggested that the government should take control of income-generating border towns to prevent further harm to importers.

Nerkh district is only 30 kilometers away from Kabul.
“If the security forces do not capture the district, Sayedabad district will also face serious threats,” said Amir Mohammad Malikzai, the district governor of Sayedabad.
""The landmines planted along the way by the enemy and their use of civilian's homes slowed our operations,” said Rohullah Ahmadzai, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.

137,Clashes Reach Gates of Faryab's Capital in Northern Afghanistan | TOLOnews,"With the centers of many districts in Faryab now under Taliban control, clashes have begun in the city of Maimana in the northern province, increasing the alarm of Faryab residents and lawmakers from the province in Kabul, who say that urgent action by the security forces is needed.
 Along with fighting in the center of Faryab, the centers of 11 districts have fallen to the Taliban over the last 24 hours. The districts include Chal, Namak Ab, Yangi Qala, Khwaja Ghar and Hazar Samooch districts in Takhar, the Dara-e-Soof-e-Bala district in Samangan, Chahar Bolak district in Balkh, Khashrod District in Nimroz, Manjigak and Khanaqah districts in Jawzjan and Kharwar district in Logar.

“The war management is weak because they are not keeping one commander two months in one assignment. They are deployed from one place to another and from that place to still another. All the time passes during these reshuffles,” said Amir Mohammad Khaksar, an MP from Takhar. 
Sar-e-Pul, Takhar and Faryab provinces in the north, Ghazni province in the center and Farah province in the west have lost the most territory to the Taliban over the last two months.

The families appeared at a press conference in Kabul on Sunday where they called for proper attention to be paid to those affected by the incident.
The families put the casualties at 90 killed and over 240 wounded, all students.
“We call on the international community, the UN, human rights defender organizations to probe the cruel attack and find the perpetrators through a probe team so that the Hazara community, especially girls, are not deprived of their right to live and be educated,” said Masooma, a member of an affected family.
Other members of the victims’ families said the government should address the plight of those wounded in the attack.
“We don’t have any demand from the government except to ensure our security,” said Rajab Ali, father of a victim.

108,Ex-VP Khalili Warns Against Further Attacks on Hazara Community | TOLOnews,"A day after two blasts occurred in the west of Kabul, former vice president Mohammad Karim Khalili warned that the people will “attempt anything” to ensure their safety if the government does not prevent “targeted attacks against Hazara community” as well as other injustices in the country. 
Khalili, who addressed a gathering of religious scholars and lawmakers from the Hazara community, said the recent attacks in the west of Kabul are “genocide,” crime against humanity and an attempt to delete the identity of the Hazara community. 
He asked the international community not to stay silent against “such crimes.” 
“They conduct targeted bombings and suicide bombings against one ethnic group and one people to remove the identity of (these) people,” Khalili said, referring to recent targeted attacks on the Hazara community.  
The two blasts in Kabul on Saturday afternoon killed seven people, all civilians, most of whom were from the Hazara community. Two similar blasts occurred earlier this month, killing nearly a dozen people, all from the same community.  
Khalili said that there is a lack of consensus among the country’s politicians over the peace process and this has delayed the formation of the Supreme State Council. He said the warring sides recently have directed their focus on war rather than peace. 
“No group can ever ensure peace in Afghanistan with force,” Khalili said. “Afghanistan’s solution is not war or force, or the continuation of a monopoly.”  
The Afghanistan Human Rights Commission, citing its assessments on some recent terrorist attacks in Kabul, said that the Hazara community in Afghanistan is vulnerable to “genocide,” reiterating that such targeted killings require comprehensive and deep investigations by an international team that should be picked by the UN.  
Since mid-May, at least five attacks were conducted in Kabul in which the majority of the victims were from the Hazara community: One included the attack on Sayed al-Shuhada High School in the west of Kabul that killed over 90 people, almost all of whom were students; two blasts targeted city buses in the west of Kabul on Tuesday; and two explosions in the west of Kabul on Thursday targeted a Corolla-model car and a minivan, killing nine civilians, all from the same community. 
“We seek cooperation from the National Security Council, the United Nations, our international allies as well as the government in this matter,” Khalili said, referring to recent attacks in the west of Kabul. 
Lawmakers from Kabul said the security forces are too few to provide safety for the residents in the capital.
“The government should not test the people’s patience. There is a possibility that our people will make attempts on their own to ensure their safety,” said Fatima Nazari, an MP from Kabul. 
Figures provided by some MPs show that at least 40 major targeted attacks have been carried out in the west of Kabul in the last two years.

Lyons said the Taliban’s intensive military campaign “will lead to increased and prolonged violence that would extend the suffering of the Afghan people and threaten to destroy much of what has been built and hard won in the last two decades.” 
She said that the Taliban’s recent advances are even more significant and are as a result of an intensified military campaign. More than 50 of Afghanistan’s 370 districts have fallen since the beginning of May.  
Most districts that have been taken surround provincial capitals, suggesting that the Taliban are positioning themselves to try and take these capitals once foreign forces are fully withdrawn.  
“This military campaign runs directly counter to recent statements by the head of the Taliban Political Commission that, and I quote, ‘We are committed to forging ahead with the other sides in an atmosphere of mutual respect and reach an agreement,’” she said. 
For the Taliban to continue this intensive military campaign would be a tragic course of action, Lyons said.  
“It should be emphatically clear that any efforts to install a militarily imposed government in Kabul would go against the will of the Afghan people, and against the stated positions of the regional countries and the broader international community,” she hinted. 
This comes as sources said Tuesday that 13 districts have fallen to the Taliban in the last 24 hours while the government retook control of three districts in the same period. 
The UN envoy said that they hoped to accelerate the stalled negotiations in Doha through a proposed conference in Turkey in April but the Taliban “never officially responded to the invitation.” 
She said that given the enormous suffering, UNAMA stresses the importance of putting victims and their needs at the forefront of the peace negotiations.  
“This must include specific protections for minorities. The ongoing, frequent attacks against the Hazara community in Kabul are a terrible reminder of how the overall conflict is being used to target certain groups,” she added. 
She hinted that there is still time to prevent the worse-case scenario from materializing.  
“We must accept the reality -- increased conflict in Afghanistan means increased insecurity for many other countries, near and far,” she added. “Regional countries have an important role to play in helping Afghanistan to stabilize and integrate more fully into the region.”

148,Atmar to UN: Taliban Not Fulfilling Commitments | TOLOnews,"Foreign Minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar on Tuesday night spoke to the United Nations Security Council online and said that the Taliban has increased violence against Afghans, especially civilians, despite the foreign troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and he said the group has failed to live up to its commitments. 
The members of the UN Security Council condemned ""in the strongest possible terms"" the recent attacks on schools, deminers in northern Baghlan province and civilians in Afghanistan, the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. 
The Afghan ministry reported that the UN said that the rights of women, children and men are not negotiable under any conditions. 
“The Taliban regime is completely unacceptable, and the international community does not support its return,” MoFA said, adding that the UN statement ""expressed its support for the resumption of meaningful talks that lead to a ceasefire and lasting peace in Afghanistan.”
International participants reassured the country that “they will continue to support the Afghan government, including the security forces, and maintain the achievements of the last two decades,” MoFA said. 
At the meeting, Atmar spoke about the violation of the Taliban's commitments. 
“The Taliban has escalated the violence despite the fact that the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan has begun,” Atmar said. “The Taliban has not fulfilled its commitment to cut ties with regional and international terrorist groups and has not participated in meaningful peace talks for months,”  he said. 
In the meantime, the UN envoy in Afghanistan Deborah Lyons in a briefing to the United Nations Security Council said the recent “intensive military campaign” by the Taliban will lead to continued violence in the country, and she reiterated that any attempt to install a government in Kabul by force will go against everyone’s interest.  
Lyons said the Taliban’s intensive military campaign “will lead to increased and prolonged violence that would extend the suffering of the Afghan people and threaten to destroy much of what has been built and hard-won in the last two decades.”  
She said that the Taliban’s recent advances are even more significant and are the result of an intensified military campaign. More than 50 of Afghanistan’s 370 districts have fallen since the beginning of May, she said. 
Most districts that have been taken are adjacent to provincial capitals, suggesting that the Taliban are positioning themselves to try and take these capitals once foreign forces are fully withdrawn, she noted.   
“This military campaign runs directly counter to recent statements by the head of the Taliban Political Commission that, and I quote, ‘We are committed to forging ahead with the other sides in an atmosphere of mutual respect (to) reach an agreement,’” she said.

248,Taliban Seeks Agreement on New Govt Before Any Ceasefire: AP | TOLOnews,"A Taliban spokesman has said they don’t want to monopolize power but insisted that there won’t be peace in Afghanistan until there is a new negotiated government in Kabul and President Ashraf Ghani is removed.
In an interview with The Associated Press, Suhail Shaheen, Taliban spokesman and a member of the group’s negotiating team, said the Taliban will lay down their weapons when a negotiated government acceptable to all sides in the conflict is installed in Kabul and Ghani’s government is gone.
“I want to make it clear that we do not believe in the monopoly of power because any governments who (sought) to monopolize power in Afghanistan in the past, were not successful governments,” said Shaheen in the interview.
“So we do not want to repeat that same formula.”
He called the talks a good beginning but said the government’s repeated demands for a ceasefire while Ghani stayed in power were tantamount to demanding a Taliban surrender.
“They don’t want reconciliation, but they want surrendering,” he said.  
Before any ceasefire, there must be an agreement on a new government “acceptable to us and to other Afghans,” he said in the AP interview. Then “there will be no war.”
Shaheen said under this new government, women will be allowed to work, go to school, and participate in politics, but will have to wear the hijab, or headscarf.
He said women won’t be required to have a male relative with them to leave their home, and that Taliban commanders in newly occupied districts have orders that universities, schools and markets operate as before, including with the participation of women and girls.  
Shaheen said some Taliban commanders had ignored the leadership's orders against repressive and drastic behavior and that several have been put before a Taliban military tribunal and punished, though he did provide specifics.
He contended the video was fake, a splicing of separate footage.
He said there are no plans to make a military push on Kabul and that the Taliban have so far “restrained” themselves from taking provincial capitals.
But he warned they could, given the weapons and equipment they have acquired in newly captured districts.
He contended that the majority of the Taliban's battlefield successes came through negotiations, not fighting.
“Those districts which have fallen to us and the military forces who have joined us ... were through mediation of the people, through talks,” he said. “They (did not fall) through fighting ... it would have been very hard for us to take 194 districts in just eight weeks.”
This comes as US Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin on Wednesday said that the withdrawal of American troops will finish by end of August.
Meanwhile, Gen. Mark Milley said that all the military operating bases outside of Kabul have been fully transferred to the Afghan Ministry of Defense and the Afghan security forces.

The nighttime curfew in the 31 provinces will be effective between 10pm and 4am to prevent terrorist activities, the Ministry of Interior said.
The new measure comes as the government forces continue to fight the Taliban in 21 provinces of the country.
“If the enemy is not pushed back and Nijrab district is not retaken and the frontline comes ahead, this will pose serious threats to the center and even to Kabul,” said MP Khadija Ilham.
“Last night, there was intense fighting in Takhar. All the people have become homeless,” said Saber Shah, a resident in Taluqan city, the center of the northeastern province of Takhar.
“One offensive was launched from the direction of the western gate and the second one from the center, but the security forces managed to repel them,” said Assadullah, a resident in Taluqan.
Meanwhile, there are reports that unidentified gunmen have killed two police officers in Kalakan district in Kabul and five civilians in the Shakar Dara district in the province.
“The government still has time to do something,” said military analyst Tahir Yarghal.
“Taliban’s attacks in many provinces have faced with defeats, our security forces are advancing each day. Territories are being liberated each day and they become under the control of the government forces,” said Fawad Aman, a deputy spokesman to Ministry of Defense.
According to the statistics provided by the Afghan security agencies, the security forces have killed 262 Taliban fighters over the past 24 hours and wounded 176 more.
The Taliban has rejected the numbers.

34,Cemeteries in Western Kabul Extend after Each Deadly Attack | TOLOnews,"Western Kabul has many hills that have been changed into cemeteries. Now, these cemeteries must expand after each deadly bombing in that part of Kabul.  
At least 70 victims from the school bombing were laid to rest in these cemeteries – in one case 20 bodies in a row.  
Residents of western Kabul said victims of suicide bombings and blasts have been buried in these cemetaries in the hundreds over the last five years.
The victims’ families said they are tired of the mass burial of civilians, especially youth. 
“They are almost full. Victims of suicide bombings and explosions are brought here,” said Hassan, a grave digger. 
The victims of the Imam Zaman Mosque attack, the attack on the Mawood tuition center, the attack on the Dasht-e-Barchi 100-bed hospital, the attack on the Kawsar tuition center, and the attack on the Sayed-ul-Shuhada school were all buried in cemeteries in the west of Kabul, mostly on the hills. 
The victims of these attacks have included many youth, children and women. 
“If it is the NDS or police, it is their duty to ensure the safety of the people… This government is really insufficient,” said Abbas Adalat, a Kabul resident. 
“Such attacks should be prevented; otherwise, the voice of students will be silenced,” said Mohammad Husain, a Kabul resident. 
Families of the victims of the school bombing said that mostly students were killed in the attack. 
“My daughter was martyred and another was wounded. How long should this war continue? It is enough,” said Ali Reza, father of Masooma, a school student who was killed in Saturday’s bombing. 
“My father could not afford the needs for our training courses,” said Amina, a sister of a victim. 
First Vice President Amrullah Saleh on Tuesday said that 86 children were killed in the Kabul school bombing.

73,Shia Clerics: Govt Failed to Prevent School Attack | TOLOnews,"The Shia Ulema Council and families of the students who were killed in the attack on the Sayed al-Shuhada school in Kabul on May 8, accused the Afghan government on Thursday of negligence in preventing the attack.
They said that a security plan was shared with the Presidential Palace, but no action was taken by the government.
The Shia Ulema Council called on the government to identify the perpetrators behind the attack, refer them to the international courts and investigate the fate of Shukria, a student who is still missing after the Kabul school attack.
Fatima, 9, is a third grade student who lost her 19-year-old sister Fatima in the attack on the school.
“Now that my sister is not here, I can't sleep, I think that she will come back in the morning,” she said.
“The government security agencies should be directed to define more effective and comprehensive security measures,” said Ustad Fayaz, a spokesman for the Shia Ulema Council.
“I couldn’t find her wherever I went including hospitals, I also asked the government, but did not get a response,” said Abdullah, Shukria’s father.
“Isn't it a clear act of genocide? I swear upon God, it is a genocide. You call yourself a government, you claim to be statesmen, if they are part of your country, then respond to them,” said Mohammad Arif, the father of one of the victims.
  The attack on Sayed-ul-Shuhada High School in the west of Kabul left at least 87 students dead and 186 more wounded. Some of the survivors are still suffering from the psychological impact of the attack.

90,Watchdog Seeks Probe into Targeted Attacks on Hazara Community | TOLOnews,"The Afghanistan Human Rights Commission, relying on its assessments about some recent terrorist attacks in Kabul, says that the Hazara community in Afghanistan are prone to “genocide,” reiterating that such targeted killings require comprehensive and deep investigation by an international team that should be picked by the UN.
Since mid-May, at least five attacks have been conducted in Kabul in which majority of the victims were from the Hazara community, including the attack on Sayed al-Shuhada High School in west of Kabul that killed over 90 people, almost all of them students, two blasts that targeted city buses in west of Kabul on Tuesday and two explosions in the west of Kabul on Thursday that targeted a corolla vehicle and a minivan, killing nine civilians, all from the same community.
“Our assessments showed that the Shia and Hazara community in Afghanistan are exposed to genocide and this requires more investigation,” the chairperson of the commission, Shahrzad Akbar, said. “That’s why our statement called for a probe team or an international probe commission.”
She added: “In recent days, we were busy in seeking justice so that an international probe team would visit Afghanistan.”
Meanwhile, a hashtag of “#StopHazaraGenocide” is rounding on social media platforms over the last two days in which social media users from within and outside the country cite recent attacks, show solidarity to each other, call for thorough probe into them and say they cannot affect the unity among Afghans. 
“Our passengers are dropped out of the car and are killed. They are killed at schools. Our children are killed. It is in fact a genocide. We have to raise our voice,” said Musa Khan Reja, an artist.
“They should pay attention that I, as a Pashtun, am a supporter of my Hazara brother and will never allow the enemy to create rupture between us by such terrorist attacks,” said Khalid Noora, an activist. 
On one of Thursday’s blasts, three members of one family, all women, including a TV anchor, were killed, and five more were wounded. One of them, a young girl, died of her wounds at a hospital in Kabul early hours of Sunday as her relatives described. 
“Please, please, prevent such attacks so that the people live with calm… Everyone is tired,” said Zabihullah Nawabi, an artist.
Figures by some sources show that at least 560 people have been killed in 14 attacks on Hazara community in Afghanistan in the last five years. Most of these attacks are suicide bombings and bomb blasts, many in the west of Kabul.

Three blasts occurred near the school on the afternoon of May 8, killing at least 90 students and wounding over 150 others. The parents of the survivors said the government has encouraged them to send back their children to school.
“I have no trust. Even I don’t know what will happen to me when I am out of the home. I don’t know whether I will return home or not,” said Shahr Banoo, a brother of a student killed in the attack.
Zahra, a student who sustained injuries in the attack, said she hasn’t been able to forget the incident because it created stress for her and other girls at the school.
“I can never forget what happened that day during the school attack,” said Zahra, who lost her sister in the attack.
The families said that they have no idea who is responsible for the attack and why the students were targeted.
“Our demand is that it should be made clear. So far, it is not known who caused the blasts,” said Ali Reza, a father of a student who was killed in the attack.
Sayed al-Shuhada School in the Dasht-e-Barchi area in the west of Kabul has at least 7,000 students. It is not known when it will be reopened to its students, or when the lockdown for education centers will end.

The summit issued and released a Fatwa (a ruling on a point of Islamic law) declaring the ongoing war in Afghanistan illegitimate.
Civil activists, citing the fatwa, called on the Taliban to stop the killing of Afghans and to put an end to the war that takes lives every day on both sides, adding that it is time for the Taliban to select the path of peace.
“I am ready to meet with you, Taliban, but you do not have the courage to fight me face to face, do you? You are stabbing us from behind, what kind of war is this? We are really sick of it,"" said Samiyeh Qaderi, a female civil society activist in Kabul.

In a statement, the civil society activists called on the United Nations and international human rights organizations to investigate the ""crimes committed by the Taliban against the people of Afghanistan"" and to put pressure on the Taliban by imposing sanctions on them.
“The Taliban not only haven't stopped their fighting but have continued their terrorist and suicide attacks against the innocent and Muslim people of Afghanistan,” said Ehsanullah Qaderi, a civil society activist, who added: ""The actions of the Taliban shows that they are not respecting any religious, Islamic or human values.”
The civil society activists affirmed that a continuation of the war in the country cannot be a solution to the crisis in Afghanistan.
“We call on the Taliban not to massacre our nation's people under the pretext of defending Islam. Do not destroy our homeland, the war in Afghanistan has no religious legitimacy. The nation and the security forces are all Muslim,” said Rahimullah Naseeri, head of the Hamnawa Youth Foundation.
The Taliban previously denied allegations of war crimes, saying the group's enemies are giving false information to human rights advocacy groups.

Mujahid says that Afghans have the right to apply rules that match the people's values; therefore, other countries should respect these rules.
Mujahid said they are committed to providing women their rights based on Islam. He says women can work in the health sector and other sectors where they are needed. He says there will be no discrimination against women.
The spokesman said there will be an improvement in the country's economy and in the people's livelihoods.
Mujahid said they want all media outlets to continue their activities. They have three suggestions: No broadcast should contradict Islamic values, they should be impartial, no one should broadcast anything that goes against national interests.
Mujahid says the Taliban have pardoned everyone and will not take revenge against anyone, including former military members and those who worked with the foreign forces. ""No one will search their houses,"" Mujahid said.
Mujahid said that damage to people and families occurred during the war accidentally and was not intentional and occurred in an uncontrolled situation. If it happened, it is unfortunate, he said.
The situation in Kabul city will soon be back to normal, Mujahid said.
""We want to establish a government that includes all sides,"" Mujahid said, adding that the Taliban want an end to the war.
In response to a question about differences between the 1990s Taliban and today's, Mujahid said the ideology and beliefs are the same because they are Muslims, but there is a change in terms of experience--they are more experienced and have a different perspective.
Mujahid said the Taliban can assure the world that Afghanistan will no longer be a hub for poppy cultivation or for the drug business, and they need the world's support to promote an alternative to poppy cultivation.

251,"UN Warns of Expanding Threat from Daesh, al Qaeda in Afghanistan | TOLOnews","The United Nations in a new report is warning that the threat from terror groups such as Daesh and al Qaeda is expanding in many places in Afghanistan where the security situation remains fragile with uncertainty surrounding the peace process and a risk of further deterioration.
The report by the UN Security Council, published Thursday, says that despite territorial, leadership, manpower and financial losses during 2020 in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces, Daesh’s Khorasan branch, or ISIL-K, has moved into other provinces, including Nuristan, Badghis, Sar-e-Pul, Baghlan, Badakhshan, Kunduz and Kabul, where fighters have formed sleeper cells.
The report says that the group has strengthened its positions in and around Kabul, where it conducts most of its attacks, targeting minorities, activists, government employees and personnel of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces. 
The report says that most recently, Daesh claimed responsibility for the brutal attack of 8 June, when 10 humanitarian deminers working with HALO Trust in Baghlan Province were killed and 16 were injured.
“In its efforts to resurge, ISIL-K has prioritized the recruitment and training of new supporters; its leaders also hope to attract intransigent Taliban and other militants who reject the Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan between the United States and the Taliban and to recruit fighters from the Syrian Arab Republic, Iraq and other conflict zones,” the report says. 
The report states that the estimates of the strength of Daesh’s Khorasan branch range widely, with one member state reporting between 500 and 1,500 fighters and another stating that it may rise to as many as 10,000 over the medium term. 
“One member state stressed that ISIL-K was largely underground and clandestine,” the report says. “Its leader, Shahab al-Muhajir, alias Sanaullah, cooperates with Sheikh Tamim, head of the al-Sadiq office.”
The report says that Tamim and his office are tasked by Daesh core to oversee the network connecting the Khorasan branch with Daesh presences in the wider region.
The UN report says that as reported by the UN Monitoring Team in its twelfth report to the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011), al Qaeda is present in at least 15 Afghan provinces, primarily in the eastern, southern and south-eastern regions. 
The report says that al Qaeda’s weekly Thabat newsletter reports on its operations inside Afghanistan. 
Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) operates under Taliban protection from Kandahar, Helmand and Nimroz provinces, the report says. 
Since the death of Asim Umar in 2019, AQIS has been led by Osama Mahmood, the report says, adding that the group consists mainly of Afghan and Pakistani nationals, but also individuals from Bangladesh, India and Myanmar. 
On 30 March, AQIS commander Dawlat Bek Tajiki (alias Abu Mohammad al-Tajiki) was killed by Afghan forces in Gyan district of Paktika province. 
“Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri is assessed by member states to be alive but ailing in Afghanistan. SayfAl Adl, his most likely successor, is reported to remain in the Islamic Republic of Iran,” the report states. 
Member states differ as to what Al Adl’s options would be if he was called upon to succeed al-Zawahiri, but most assess that he would have to move and that basing himself in Afghanistan might not be an option, the report says.
The leadership succession calculations of Al Qaeda are complicated by the peace process in Afghanistan where, under the Doha agreement of February 2020, the Taliban is committed to suppressing any international terrorist threat, the report says, but adds that it is unclear whether Sayf-Al Adl would be able to travel to Afghanistan to take up the position of leader of Al Qaeda. 
The report mentions that some member states point to his history of living and operating in Africa and assess that he might choose to base himself there.
The report also says that the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, IMU, faces financial difficulties and a Taliban that is less accommodating than it used to be.

204,70 Villages in Sarobi Under Taliban Control: Officials | TOLOnews,"Local officials in Kabul province's Sarobi district, east of Kabul city, on Thursday said that 70 villages out of 130 are under Taliban control.
Kabul governor Mohammad Yaqoub said that militants associated with Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba and other groups are playing a role in the fight in Sarobi.
Residents in Sarobi said that the Taliban has threatened to launch an attack on the Sarobi bazaar.

“The Taliban are trying to take over the ruby mines in Jagdalak district. They don’t have the capacity to extract it, but we are trying to prevent their control of it,” said Sarobi's district governor.
“The enemy is trying to impose an economic siege on Kabul, they want to put pressure on the economic arteries, therefore the enemy focuses on our transporation routes in the east,” said Kabul governor Mohammad Yaqoub.
“There is fighting day and night, only the bazaar remains, some days ago they killed several secuity force members and took others hostage,” said Zahidullah, a resident in Sarobi.
Kabul has 14 districts, five of which are under threat, according to Afghan security officials.

211,Taliban Opposed to Turkey's Running of Airport Security | TOLOnews,"The Taliban on Sunday announced its opposition to an agreement between the US and Turkey for the latter to take over security of Hamid Karzai International Airport, with a spokesman of the group saying that they are against the presence of any foreign troops after the given deadline for their withdrawal from Afghanistan. 
 
The US and coalition forces are expected to fully leave by August 31. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said that an agreement has been reached over the post-withdrawal Kabul airport security.
 
“If they remain within the framework of NATO or Turkey or any other country, it will not be acceptable both for the people of Afghanistan and for the Taliban,” former Taliban commander Sayed Akbar Agha said. 
 
Erdogan announced the agreement on July 9.
 
“Our defense minister met with the US defense secretary, and we had a meeting with US and NATO to discuss the future of the Hamid Karzai International Airport,” Erdogan said on July 9. “We decided on what we accept in this respect and which conditions we don’t agree upon.” 
 
The Afghan government welcomed the move. The Civil Aviation Authority on Sunday said that a new defense system has been activated at Hamid Karzai International Airport. 
 
“We welcome friendly countries for their cooperation in strengthening the capacity and management of the control of airports,” Defense Ministry’s spokesman Rohullah Ahmadzai said. 
 
The new defense system at the Kabul airport has been established with the help of Afghanistan’s allies, a government spokesman said. 
 
“Right now, our foreign allies are cooperating with us so that we can find the capacity to use the weapon (defense system),” said Gen. Ajmal Shinwari, a spokesman for the government forces.
 
Turkey has been helping in Hamid Karzai Airport’s security since 2013, officials said. 
 
“It creates some type of concern--why are they trying to secure their route? For fleeing? On the other hand, it is a type of hope as it gives a feeling of the international community’s presence,” said retired general Zahir Azimi.

8,"Taliban, US in Talks Over Full Withdrawal by July: Sources | TOLOnews","Americans and the Taliban are discussing the possibility of ending the withdrawal process by the beginning of July, sources familiar with the matter said.  
The Taliban will return to the talks, will attend the Turkey conference and will reduce violence if there is an agreement on the matter, the sources said. 
The US began its withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan this week, and, based on President Joe Biden’s decision, the process was to be completed by Sept. 11. According to the Doha agreement, the US was expected to complete the withdrawal by May 1.  
The Taliban considers the postponement of the withdrawal date a violation of the Doha agreement.
“The US has set a deadline for itself and it is possible that the Taliban will not agree to it and then a deadline in the middle will be agreed upon,” said former Taliban commander Sayed Akbar Agha. 
US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad arrived in Kabul on Monday and, according to sources, he intends to discuss his regional trip and the upcoming Istanbul conference with Afghan officials, along with other topics related to the peace process. 
Khalilzad met with Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum in Uzbekistan this week. He also met with Uzbekistan Foreign Minister Abdulaziz Kamilov and discussed the Afghan peace process. 
“Discussions were held on the peace process and the Istanbul conference as well as political consensus,” Dostum’s spokesman Ehsan Nairo said. 
However, Second Vice President Sarwar Danesh at an event on Monday called the Taliban a rebellious and fugitive group that is thirsty for power. 
“The Taliban, because it has turned away from peace, is considered a fugitive group because, based on a verse of the Holy Quran, if a group violates the call for peace, it is considered violent and fugitive,” Danesh said. 
 
Khalilzad also met with peace negotiators in Doha during his trip to Qatar last week. 
 
“Efforts to hold the upcoming Turkey conference were welcomed. And the US envoy assured his country’s continued support to the government and the people of Afghanistan,” said Ghulam Farooq Majroh, a republic negotiator. 
 
The Istanbul conference was delayed two times because the Taliban backed out. It is expected to be held late this month.

11,"In Wake of Logar Attack, Ghani Says Afghan Education Under Threat | TOLOnews","President Ashraf Ghani at an event on Tuesday said that Afghanistan’s education system is now in jeopardy as the country’s enemies are targeting students and destroying infrastructure.
He indirectly referred to the recent car bomb attack in Logar province that killed at least 26 people, most of whom were students.
He inaugurated buildings for 59 schools in 22 provinces during the event and said the education sector is the key to development in the country.
“Today, our education is faced with a cruel attack. Today our student, who should be planning his future with a calm mind, is assassinated,” Ghani said.
First Vice President Amrullah Saleh said that the country’s schools are accommodating students three times beyond capacity.
“Today, in our schools, there are three times more girls and boys than their capacity,” said Saleh, who expressed hopes that the quest for education among Afghan children and youth will continue.
The acting minister of education, Rangina Hamidi, said that her ministry has facilitated education with minimal facilities.
“Education is the backbone for Afghanistan, and I assure you that we will be able to have a brighter future for Afghanistan if this sector improves,” Hamidi said.
This comes amid complaints about a lack of school buildings and schoolteachers in some provinces, including Kabul.
The Ministry of Education on April 10 said there is a need for at least 50,000 new teachers for the country’s schools, as the current number of instructors is not sufficient.
Afghanistan’s schools have at least 220,000 teachers for 9.7 million students across the country.
Along with the lack of school buildings, textbooks and other educational resources, the lack of teachers is said to be one of the major challenges facing the education sector in the country.

12,US: Strong Intl Consensus Against a Taliban Military Takeover | TOLOnews,"The US Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad has said that a Taliban plan to seize control of Afghanistan with a military takeover would not be acceptable to the world. 
According to a statement from the US embassy, Khalilzad ""emphasized that there was strong consensus within both the regional and international community against any effort by the Taliban to pursue a military takeover. Only a negotiated settlement can end over 40 years of war in Afghanistan and Ambassador Khalilzad pledged common cause with Afghan leaders to accelerate efforts to reach an inclusive settlement and permanent and comprehensive ceasefire.”
In separate meetings with Afghan political leaders in Kabul, Khalilzad called for a political consensus to be formed among Afghan political leaders to help pave the way for successful peace negotiation talks with the Taliban.
Meanwhile, President Ashraf Ghani has said that with the completion of the withdrawal of foreign forces, all decisions regarding the country will be taken by the Afghan people and the government. He again called on the Taliban to surrender to peace.
He said that the Afghan government is ready for all scenarios if provoked.
“Now that the foreign forces are leaving, all national decisions will be taken by the Afghan people and the government,” said Ghani, amid rumors about the release of the remaining Taliban prisoners from the Afghan government jails.
Meanwhile, a member of the High Council of National Reconciliation (HCNR) who met Khalilzad in Kabul said that in the meeting discussions were held about the success of the upcoming UN-led summit on Afghanistan in Turkey.
“He (Khalilzad) stressed the importance of the existence of the system, the protection of the security forces and the army,” said Haji Din Mohammad, a member of the HCNR.
“If the consensus is limited to the meeting of a few political leaders, this can’t be evaluated as a solution,” said political analyst Wais Naseri.
Meanwhile, President Ashraf Ghani in an article in Foreign Affairs said that the Afghan government respects the decision of US President of Joe Biden about withdrawing troops from Afghanistan and views it as a moment of both opportunity and risk for itself, for Afghans, for the Taliban, and for the region.
“For me, as the elected leader of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, it is another opportunity to reiterate and further my commitment to peace,” wrote Ghani.
Ghani also said that his government remains ready to continue talks with the Taliban and, if it meant peace would be secured, he would be willing to end his term early.
On the US forces' withdrawal, he said: “For the Afghan nation, the announcement of the U.S. withdrawal is another phase in our long-term partnership with the United States. Afghanistan has been through consequential withdrawals before.”
Ghani said that the US decision surprised the Taliban and their patrons in Pakistan
“The US decision surprised the Taliban and their patrons in Pakistan, and it has forced them to make a choice. Will they become credible stakeholders, or will they foster more chaos and violence? If the Taliban choose the latter path, the ANDSF will fight them. And if the Taliban still refuse to negotiate, they will be choosing the peace of the grave,” said Ghani in his article.
Ghani said that Afghans cannot and absolutely will not go back to the horrors of the 1990s.

16,Mujahideen Ready to Fight if Taliban Reject Peace: Massoud | TOLOnews,"Ahmad Massoud, the son of Afghanistan’s National Hero Ahmad Shah Massoud, on Wednesday said that the Afghan mujahideen are ready for a military confrontation with the Taliban if the group does not abide by its commitments to peace.
In a gathering in Kabul, Massoud and former jihadi commanders called on the Afghan people and mujahideen commanders to stay unified, stating that President Ashraf Ghani has been skeptical of the strength of the mujahideen and has sidelined them from the issues at hand.
Massoud said there is no justification for war while the foreign forces are withdrawing from the country.
“In case the parties see a military solution as the way out for Afghanistan, then we will also make our own military preparations within the structure of the mujahideen, with the suggestions of the mujahideen, with the support of the people and under the umbrella of the Ulemas to bring an Islamic system that is the genuine demand of the people,” said Massoud.
“If the negotiations reach a conclusion, that will be good, but if the Taliban tries to enter Kabul with force or seeks to occupy Afghanistan, this wide resistance front should start a revolution against any bullying move,” said Sayed Mohammad Ali Jawed, the head of the Harakat-e-Islami party. 
“The president has no trust in the power and strength of the mujahideen, I pray that neither they nor us become in need of each other,” said Ahmad Massoud.
Critics at the gathering accused some politicians of making deals in pursuit of personal agendas.
Massoud’s warning follows media reports weeks ago that men are taking up arms in Takhar, Baghlan, Daikundi and Baghlan provinces.

21,Khalilzad Says US Will Back Republic If Taliban Rejects Peace | TOLOnews,"US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad on May 7 said that the United States will stand with Afghans who support the Republic if the Taliban do not choose peace. 
He made the remarks after concluding his trip to the region in which he visited Tashkent, Doha Kabul and Dushanbe. He said that he attended a meeting with their allies in Berlin.
Echoing a joint statement released after the meeting in Berlin on Friday, Khalilzad said in a tweet that “if the Taliban do not choose peace, a future based on consensus and compromise, then we will stand with Afghans who strive to keep the Republic intact.” 
But he reiterated that “Republic political unity is a must.”
Khalilzad said that there is a unique international consensus for peace, rooted in the support for a negotiated settlement, an end to violence, and rejection of any attempt to impose a military solution.
Afghan leaders from all sides of the conflict should seize this opportunity and negotiate a political settlement to end their 40 yearlong war, he said.
International consensus does not stop at peace, he said, adding that the world remains steadfast in its support of Afghanistan as the country enters a new phase.
This comes as special envoys and special representatives of the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, NATO, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States in a statement emphasized the need for continued international support to Afghan National Defense and Security Forces and said it will be necessary to ensure Afghanistan can defend itself against internal and external threats.
The envoys affirmed their commitment to UNSC resolution 2513 (2020) and emphasized that they oppose the establishment in Afghanistan of any government by force which would constitute a threat to regional stability.
The envoys acknowledged the widespread and sincere demand of the Afghan people for an end to the war and a fair and lasting peace and confirmed that such a peace can only be achieved through an inclusive, negotiated political settlement among Afghans, according to the statement that was published by Germany’s Foreign Office on Friday.
This comes as violence has increased across the country following the Biden administration's announcement on the withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan. The announcement has been accompanied by fears and concerns about the country's future once all international troops leave Afghanistan.

Stanekzai made the remarks during a virtual meeting with envoys from the UN, Norway, Sweden, Germany, US and the UK.
Stanekzai clarified that forming a coalition government was not a solution to the conflict, stating that there is need for a strong centralized Islamic government in which the rights of every Afghan citizen is protected, not a few.
“The Islamic Emirate ( the term used for Taliban movement) does not accept a coalition government. There is a need for a strong centralized Islamic system, a system in which every Afghan see their rights, not a few people, a system in which the rights of every Afghan national is reflected,” said Stanekzai.
He also said that the conditional release of 7,000 Taliban prisoners and the removal of names of Taliban leaders from the UN blacklist were a key to move the peace process forward.
“Whenever a member of our delegation wants to go and meet our leaders or military commanders, it takes them days and this causes disruption in the peace process,” said Stanekzai, indirectly asking the removal of Taliban’s names from the UN blacklist.
The Taliban negotiator also assured that Afghan women will be allowed to play a role in the political process of the country and that freedom of speech will be operating within the framework of Islamic Sharia.

26,Most School Attack Victims Were From Low-Income Families | TOLOnews,"The triple blasts near a school in the west of Kabul on Saturday took 63 lives, many of whom were female students from poor families living in Dasht-e-Barchi, one of the most low-income areas in Kabul.
Their ages ranged from 13 to 18 years old and they were attending classes from 7 to 12th grade at school. Some of them paid their expenses from carpet weaving.
Kamila, 13, was the only literate person in her family. She sought education to help her family get of their current economic situation. Gulsoom, 17, another victim, wanted to become a pilot.
The school is located near a hillside, surrounded by mostly one-story houses, most of which are made of mud.
“She did carpet weaving at nights and studied during the day so that she could continue her education and afford her expenses,” Kamila’s mother said.
“It is hard for me to go to school and study because we have lost our hope in the government,” said Zahra, Kamila’s sister.
Tahira, who shared a class with her sister Gilsoom--who was killed--survived the attack but is wounded. Tahira, too, paid for her and her family’s needs with carpet weaving.
“She earned 200 Afs a day and spent it for her needs at school,” Gulsoom’s mother Masooma said.
“Our family said she should not go to school because her future would not be guaranteed, but I insisted that she should go to school because it was a state school,” said Husain, the brother of a victim.
Raihana, another victim, also wanted to become a pilot.
Kamila, who was killed in the blast, wanted to become a police officer, according to their relatives.
“I saw the first body, I saw the second, and the third was my own Raihana,” said Mohammad Ali, Raihana’s father.
“We went to school together that day. She (Raihana) was very happy compared to other days. She told me that she was very happy that day,” said Habiba, Raihana’s sister.
Tahira says her wounds from the blast are minor but the pain from losing her sister has given her a bigger pain.
Families of the students said they have lost their hope for the future as they have no idea if they will be able to continue to send their children to school.

27,Survivors of Kabul School Attack: We Will Never Quit | TOLOnews,"Students who survived the deadly bombings outside a school in western Kabul on Saturday vowed to continue their education despite having lost dozens of classmates in the deadly incident that killed 63 people and wounded over 150 others.
Their families said that such incidents are an attack on Afghanistan’s future, and they dampen the students’ desire to get an education. 
The attack started with a car bomb explosion outside Sayed-ul-Shuhada High school as hundreds of girls were leaving the school, which is located on a hillside in the Dasht-e-Barchi area in Kabul’s District 13. 
The surviving students said the only way to defeat Afghanistan’s enemies is through education. 
“We will resume from where we fall… No one and nothing will impede us from getting an education,” said Madina Nekzad, a student. 
“I am very upset, but we want to continue on this path. We will never surrender,” said Frozan, a student. 
Mobina, a student at a private school in Dasht-e-Barchi who visited those wounded from the incident, said the pain of losing friends and families in such incidents is very oppressive.
She expressed her feelings by reading a poem: “We will enter the ground stronger… Our pen will be our weapon… We will fight them with the pen… I now have realized that they are afraid of us because they stabbed us from behind.” 
“We went without dinners to afford money for their books and notebooks so they could one day support us. But now what will be our chances for the future be in sending them to school?"" asked a teacher. 
Victims’ families said that the attack on children and innocent teenagers is not condoned by any religion. 
“What was their sin? What law has allowed such a massacre?” asked a relative of the victims. 
This comes as a car bomb attack killed dozens of students in Logar province last week, leading President Ghani to say that education in the country is under attack.

32,UN Security Council Condemns Kabul’s Deadly School Attack | TOLOnews,"The members of the Security Council condemned in “the strongest terms the atrocious and cowardly terrorist attack that took place in Kabul, Afghanistan, on 8 May 2021,” the UN said in a statement on Monday night.
The attack, which took place at Sayed-ul-Shuhada High School in the Dasht-e-Barchi area in Kabul’s District 13, resulted in the deaths of more than 60 people, many of whom were girls. More than 150 civilians were wounded.
“The members of the Security Council expressed their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the Government of Afghanistan and they wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured,” the council said in a statement.
The members of the Security Council expressed their deep concern about the continuing high level of violence and the security situation in Afghanistan, especially the number of civilian casualties, and stressed the importance of sustained efforts to end violence and protect civilians, it said.
“The Security Council reaffirms the right to education and its contribution to the achievement of peace and security and expresses grave concern about the significant number of attacks on schools and education facilities in Afghanistan in recent months, as well as the significant implications of such attacks on the safety of students and their ability to enjoy their right to education,” according to the statement.
The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that “terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.”
The members of the Security Council underlined the need to hold “perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice.”
“They urged all States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, to cooperate actively with the Government of Afghanistan and all other relevant authorities in this regard,” the statement said.
The members of the Security Council reiterated that “any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed.

57,Khalilzad Says Fears of Taliban Conquering Kabul Are Overblown | TOLOnews,"As US has started the withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan after 20 years of engagement, special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad on Tuesday said that the prediction that the Taliban will quickly overrun Afghan forces and conquer Kabul after full withdrawal of international troops are unduly pessimistic. 
“I personally believe that the statements that their forces will disintegrate and the Talibs will take over in short order are mistaken,” Khalilzad told the House Foreign Affairs Committee as quoted in a report by AP. 
Violence has remained high in the country even after a three-day ceasefire from May 12 to May 15. The Defense Ministry reported clashes in 18 provinces just a day after the ceasefire ended. 
Khalilzad said that the Afghan government and the Taliban should do their part in the peace process. He stressed the need for Pakistan’s role in the peace efforts in Afghanistan.  
“We remain in close touch with Pakistan leaders, pressing them to exercise their considerable leverage over the Taliban to reduce violence and support a negotiated settlement,” Khalilzad said. “I believe Pakistan understands that the protracted war in Afghanistan is not in its interest.” 
But US lawmakers expressed their concern and skepticism over the future of the country once American troops leave Afghanistan. 
“It seems all but certain the Taliban will try to overrun the country and return it to a pre-9/11 state after we have withdrawn,” Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, said. “They’ve already ramped up their attacks, taking new territory and bases since the (Biden) announcement was made. Without a military presence in country, the US is giving them room to deepen their relationship with terrorist groups like al-Qaida, who may seek to launch external attacks on us and our allies from the country once again.”  
Some US lawmakers expressed their concerns about the future of women rights in the country once the international troops leave the country.
But Khalilzad said that the Taliban should also understand that the Afghanistan of today is very different than it was 20 years ago.  
Khalilzad said that the US will maintain asset in the region and will continue to work closer with the Afghan counterparts.

76,Political Leaders Warn Taliban against Push for Military Win | TOLOnews,"Two influential political leaders at an event in Kabul on Friday warned of “severe consequences” against the Taliban if the group continues violence with the hope to win militarily. They warned they are preparing for confrontation, but they keep their hope that the country will not enter another bloody war after US and coalition forces leave.  
Salahuddin Rabbani, the leader of the main faction of Jamiat-e-Islami, said today’s generation of Afghanistan is more eager than their previous generation when it comes to defending the country and its values against hostilities. He said the people are ready to safeguard the country’s hard-won gains of the last two decades as their “red line.” 
Rabbani said the Taliban should not miscalculate that the foreign troops' withdrawal will help them to win militarily. 
“The Taliban should know that the people of Afghanistan and the present generation believe in freedom and justice and they are determined than the past towards these components,” Rabbani said.  
He indirectly questioned President Ashraf Ghani’s policy towards Pakistan, saying that “wrong policies” by some people instead pushed Afghanistan towards isolation instead of isolating Islamabad in international stage. 
At the same event, Mohammad Mohaqiq, the leader of Hizb-e-Wahdat-e-Islami Afghanistan, also expressed his all-out support to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces in their campaign against insurgents, and said he is ready to fight against the Taliban when necessary. 
Both leaders expressed these remarks at a ceremony marking the 10th assassination anniversary of two prominent mujahideen commanders Gen. Daud Daud and Shah Jahan Noori. 
“Some elements claimed that they have isolated the country, and another has been isolated, but the reality is totally different from their perception. The unfortunate thing is that today Afghanistan has been isolated due to the wrong policies,” stated Rabbani, indirectly referring to President Ashraf Ghani’s claims in the past that he had isolated Pakistan. 
Mohaqiq called on the international community to save Afghanistan from becoming a sanctuary for international terrorism once again. 
“We firmly stand with the people, the government, the National Defense and Security Forces in support of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan,” Mohaqiq said.
Other speakers at the event stressed the need for a thorough investigation into the targeted killing of influential figures. 
“Regretfully, the situation is like the one in which people have to choose between bad and worse. People’s future shouldn’t move towards a misleading path,” said Mohammad Alam Ezedyar, the deputy speaker of the Senate, the Meshrano Jirga.  
“We are being killed one by one, but no voice is raised, no movement is taking shape and no decision is taken to investigate these cases. We are tired now,” said Mohib Noori, brother of a former mujahedeen commander. 
Violence has remained high in the country as the withdrawal of US and coalition forces is underway. Analysts argue that a full withdrawal will create serious flaws in the security arena for the Afghan forces. But Afghanistan’s allies have said that they will continue supporting the Afghan government and the security forces after their pullout. 
NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday said that the Alliance has helped provide security in Afghanistan for almost two decades, but the Afghan government and the Afghan forces are strong enough to stand on their own feet in absence of international troops’ support.

77,Victims’ Families Seek Thorough Probe into School Attack | TOLOnews,"Twenty days after multiple blasts near Sayed al-Shuhada High School in Kabul, victims’ families at an event on Friday said the government so far has not shared the results of its investigation; therefore, there is a need for a thorough probe into the incident.
The families warned that they will not send their children to school unless there are full-proof security measures by the government to protect the school from similar attacks in the future.
They also called on the Afghan government to identify organizers of the attack and renew its security policy for the west of Kabul. 
“Any school you attack will be more crowded and any tuition center you attack will emerge more vibrant,” said Abdullah Fazli, member of Afghanistan’s Shia Religious Scholars Council. 
“The government has not provided any response to us about who is behind the attack and why it happened,” said Mohammad Hakim, a victim’s family member. 
At least 90 people, most of them students, were killed and over 150 more were wounded in the attack that started with a car bomb explosion near the school and was followed by two more IED blasts in the same area. 
“I am wearing black to mourn the loss of my brother, but I don’t want to lose another brother,” said Habibullah, a family member of one of the victims. 
 “We want the school to reopen so that we do not miss our studies,” said Zahra, a student at Sayed al-Shuhada school.

92,Taliban Assures Afghan Interpreters on Their Safety | TOLOnews,"Amidst foreign troops withdrawal, thousands of Afghan interpreters and staff members have expressed concerns about threats against them, but the Taliban in a statement said on Monday that the Afghans can continue their normal life, and that they will not face any threat. 
“The Islamic Emirate will not perturb them but calls them to return to their normal lives and if they do have expertise, in any filed, to sever their country. They shall not be in a danger on our port,” a statement by Taliban reads.
The Taliban said that those Afghans who worked with international troops should not fear and should continue living a peaceful life in their own country.
“If they are using the danger as an excuse to bolster their fake asylum case, then that is their own problem,” Taliban said.
US President Joe Biden announced in April to withdraw all American troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11. The announcement was followed by concerns about the political future of Afghanistan.
As US and NATO troops continue withdrawing from Afghanistan, dozens of Afghan workers who have partnered with foreigners over the past 20 years are concerned about the situation and are seeking protection.      
Concerned about the approach of September 11 - the deadline for all foreign troops to leave Afghanistan – these translators and employees said their lives would face serious threats after all foreign troops including France leave the country.      
The workers say that staying in Afghanistan is like a nightmare for them because they receive constant threats because they worked with coalition forces.   
Meanwhile, another group of Afghans who have worked with Canadian forces in Afghanistan gathered in front of the Canadian embassy in Kabul and called on the Canadian government and the United Nations to help them find asylum in Western countries as foreign troops, including Canadians, are leaving the country by September 11.   
The translators and employees, who were employed by the Canada forces in Afghanistan, said they have been repeatedly threatened with death and will not be able to live in Afghanistan after the complete withdrawal of foreign troops.  
Thousands of Afghans have worked with foreign forces in Afghanistan as translators and workers since the coalition forces came to Afghanistan in  2001. The exact number of these locally-employed staff is not available.
Afghan translators and other employees who have worked with foreign forces in Afghanistan have been threatened by various groups for cooperating with these forces. Dozens have lost their lives while hundreds have been wounded. 
Recently, the United States government announced that it would provide special immigrant visas to 18,000 Afghan translators and their families who backed US missions during the past 20 years.

Meanwhile, there are reports that security forces have retreated from Arghanchkhaw district of Badakhshan in northern Afghanistan.
In the south, officials from the provincial council of Uruzgan said that the Taliban has reached the outskirts of Charcheno district and have asked security forces to evacuate the district center.

Reports state that fighting has occurred in at least 70 districts across the nation in the past 24 hours.
Local officials in Badakhshan said that widespread fighting has continued in 12 districts of Badakhshan.
“Security forces were deployed in two or three checkpoints, but we asked the security forces to evacuate the schools so that the youth can pursue their regular schooling,” said Khalil Rahman Jawad, the commander of Badakhshan.
“13 districts in Badakhshan are facing imminent threats,” said MP Zabiullah Atiq.
In Badghis province, there are reports that nearly 100 security force members have surrendered to the Taliban in Abkamari district and given up two Humvees and a large number of weapons.

“The fighting started at 3:00 am, the brave security forces fought back bravely and gave them a strong response,” said Abdul Waris Sherzai.
Fighting is getting worse in Uruzgan,” said Najibullah, a resident.
War has significantly increased in Afghanistan after the official announcement of the withdrawal of foreign forces from the country. There are reports that the centers of 20 districts have fallen to the Taliban in the past 2 months.
The surge in the level of violence comes as US and NATO forces have been continuing their pullout from Afghanistan. 
Meanwhile, there are reports the Pentagon is considering whether to intervene with warplanes or drones in the event that Kabul is in danger of falling to the Taliban, though no decisions have been made, The New York Times reported on Wednesday.  
Senior officials told The New York Times that the Pentagon is considering seeking authorization to carry out airstrikes to support Afghan security forces if Kabul or another major city is in danger of falling to the Taliban. 
The report mentioned that Biden and his national security aides had previously suggested that once US troops left Afghanistan, air support would end as well, except for strikes aimed at terrorist groups that could be considered a threat to American interests.

121,Abdullah: Taliban is Emboldened by US Pullout But Cannot Win | TOLOnews,"Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the High Council for National Reconciliation (HCNR), on Wednesday said that the US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan paved the way for the Taliban to increase the level of violence.
Abdullah said that the Taliban is expanding the war and seeks to be the winner on the battlefield but it will not be able to dominate Afghanistan militarily.
The comments came at an event in Kabul organized by the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) and UN Women titled “Gender-Responsive Ceasefires.” 
“The Taliban used the opportunity (troop withdrawal) and tried to be the winner on the battlefield, and their day-and-night activity indicates this reality,” said Abdullah.
“It is impossible for the Taliban to take over Afghanistan through war,” cautioned Abdullah.
Meanwhile, the UN also called on the Afghan warring sides not to lose the current opportunity for peace.
Abdullah said the Taliban will be responsible for a ""major historic loss"" if they insist on fighting and reject the current opportunity for peace.
“The Afghans have been pushing for a ceasefire since the start of the talks, the entire international community and the UN secretary general have called for a ceasefire,” Abdullah said.
Abdullah also praised the sacrifices of the Afghan National Security and Defense Forces (ANDSF).
“We support these forces (ANDSF) who are the guardians of peace in the future and we should encourage their morale, we should avoid making them worry unnecessarily,” said Abdullah.
“Ceasefire and ending hostilities are the fundamental demand of the people, expansion of violence shouldn’t obstruct efforts for peace,” said Shahrzad Akbar, the head of AIHRC.
Mette Knudsen, deputy special representative (Political) for Afghanistan in the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA):
“Afghanistan has experienced a short period of respite during Eid ceasefires that have been put in place both by the Taliban and the government this year and the years past. These have been positive steps and gave some hope to people and a limited sense of safety, but they are definitely not enough and the violence remains unacceptably high,” she said.
Meanwhile, Shahrzad Akbar, the head of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC), also said that the warring parties should stop further violence and make peace.
Afghan women are worried about their future following a dramatic surge in the level of targeted attacks on women in recent months, said UNAMA.

Two former vice presidents, Mohammad Yunus Qanooni and Mohammad Karim Khalili, as well as Babur Farahmand, the deputy head of the reconciliation council, and presidential adviser Akram Khpulwak, are also part of the team.
“The delegation will focus on intra-Afghan talks and facilitation of the negotiations,” said university lecturer Faiz Mohammad Zaland.
This comes as the negotiating teams from the Afghan Republic and the Taliban met in Doha on Wednesday.
“Any effort which is carried out for peace is important. The trip of these political leaders will have its impacts, but the question is how they will manage to build trust between Kabul and Doha,” said Nasrullah Stanekzai, a law professor and analyst.
This comes as violence has significantly increased over the past two months and has left dozens killed and wounded.
Abdullah, who is in Turkey for Antalya Diplomacy Forum on Friday called on the Taliban to engage in talks, reiterating that there is a “real opportunity” for peace in the country that should be utilized.
While in Turkey, Abdullah met with foreign ministers of Iran and Pakistan.  
In meeting with Iran Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, Abdullah said they exchanged views on the Afghan peace process, intra-Afghan talks, the latest political and security developments, and the two countries' bilateral relations.

135,MoFA: Islamabad Has Leverage to Push Taliban to Peace Talks | TOLOnews,"In reaction to remarks by Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) on Sunday said that Islamabad has effective tools to “encourage Taliban leaders to start meaningful peace negotiations.”
In an interview with TOLOnews aired on Saturday, Qureshi said Taliban leadership “lives in Afghanistan” and that the leaders of the group are visiting Pakistan “for facilitating the peace process.”
But the Afghan Foreign Ministry said that such remarks that affect bilateral ties and progress in the peace process should be avoided.
The ministry said there is a need for Pakistan’s sincere cooperation and the implementation of its commitments to Afghanistan to achieve peace in the country.
Qureshi in his interview said Pakistan is unfairly blamed for problems in Afghanistan.
“Pakistan is not responsible for the failure within. Pakistan is not responsible for the squabbling that is going on in Afghanistan. Pakistan is not responsible if the Afghan leadership cannot sit and work out a peace deal. We’re not responsible for that. It’s yours,” he said.
Foreign Minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar at an event titled “Terrorism Threat Transforming” held by the Antalya Democracy Forum in Turkey on Sunday said Afghanistan can make peace with the Taliban but they should stop the “insurgency.”
“We can make peace with the Taliban because they are Afghans, but they have to stop terrorism, they have to stop killing people and they have to stop cooperating with international terrorists. However, we cannot make peace with al Qaeda, Daesh and other terrorist groups who are not Afghans. We have no political reason to work with them. Our only goal is for them to leave our country,” said Atmar.
Qureshi’s remarks on Pakistan’s ties with the Taliban sparked reactions in both Afghanistan and Pakistan.
“Qureshi was defending the Taliban in a way as if he was the Taliban’s foreign minister, not Pakistan’s,” said Pakistani lawmaker Mohsin Dawar who is also a member of Pashtun Tahafuz Movement, referring to Qureshi’s interview with TOLOnews.
On Twitter, Dawar said: “He (Qureshi) appears to have been tasked to do this by those who control his government and the Taliban. Those who support the Taliban cannot claim to be working for peace.”
“It is a shameful remark in indeed, and it is like seeing the sun but saying it does not exist. It is clear like the sun that the Taliban’s centers are in Pakistan, and they are their strongest supporter,” said Mursal Nabizada, an MP from Kabul. 
Qureshi said in the interview that Afghanistan should accept the Durand Line as an international border as a ""good neighbor,"" but Afghan leaders took issue with his comment. 
“There should be patience in regard to important national issues like borders--the problems we have with our neighbors, not only with Pakistan but other neighbors,” Hizb-e-Islami leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar said. 
Qureshi warned that Afghanistan will move towards a civil war if the situation is not managed by the Afghan leadership.

But he reiterated that this support – to Afghan forces – will be over the horizon, over the horizon logistical support and some financial support.  
He also said that the removal of US combat forces, which is what the retrograde is all about, ends the combat mission in Afghanistan for the United States. 
On Tuesday, US and NATO forces commander Gen. Scott Miller said the United States will support the Afghan security forces as foreign forces leave the country.  
Miller said that the Taliban’s expansion of violence makes it difficult to achieve peace.

242,"Taliban Has 'Deep Ties' With Al-Qaeda, Other Groups: Ghani | TOLOnews","President Ashraf Ghani visited the Special Operations Command Center in Kabul on Wednesday and said that the Taliban has “deep ties"" with Al-Qaeda, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed and the group want Afghanistan “to become a haven for insurgents.”
“The government will never allow this to happen,” President Ghani said while visiting the center to give a greeting for Eid, the Presidential Palace said in a statement. Ghani pledged to provide ""any kind of support,"" for Afghan special operations forces.
He promised to address the needs of families of the security force members who have lost their lives while serving their country.
""Our goal is to protect Afghanistan, freedom, equality and the achievements of the last 20 years, but the intention of the enemy is dark,"" Ghani said, ""and you prove to the enemy they will take their dreams to the grave.""
The president said that ""the water"" and the ""strategic position"" is Afghanistan's, and because of this ""enemies are plotting and want to take revenge on us by war.”


 



He also said: “We have the will to establish a just and lasting peace” in the country, “but the enemies must know that we will never surrender. You have the capability to show to the world and any other force and prove your capacity.”
“Afghanistan is the common home for all Afghans, and it is our national duty to protect it until the last moment of our lives,” he added.


 



On Tuesday, President Ghani in a speech for Eid said recent deeds by the Taliban showed the group has “no will” for peace and, going forward, decisions by the government will be made based on that.
Ghani said the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan’s decision to send a high-ranking delegation to Doha for negotiations was to determine their will for peace.
“The Taliban made clear many things. Mr. Abdullah told me some minutes ago that there is no will for peace among the Taliban. We sent the delegation ... to show that we have the will for peace and we are ready for sacrifice for it, but they (Taliban) have no will for peace and we should make decisions based on this,” Ghani said.
Ghani said this Eid has been dedicated to Afghan forces to honor their sacrifices and courage, especially in the last three months.
“Afghanistan’s security and defense forces have made many sacrifices in the last 20 years, especially in the last three months, to defend this soil and honor this homeland,” Ghani said.
He added that he has spent the last week working on an “urgent and practical plan” to overcome the current situation. President Ghani said Afghans should prove in their actions that they are united.
“This plan has been prepared. It has two parts in terms of security,” he said. He added that one part of the plan is setting priorities for security and defense forces.
He said a firm stance by the people for the next three to six months will change the situation.
Ghani reiterated that there is a need for national support and national defense and said the future of Afghanistan will be made in Afghanistan and by Afghans.
He said today’s Afghanistan is not the one it was 20 years ago and every city has signs of development.
“There is no place for forming militias and arbitrariness in this country,” he said.
He said the Taliban “destroyed 260 public buildings” and that if they are Afghans they should avoid eliminating public establishments and people’s houses.
Ghani said the government released 5,000 Taliban prisoners but the group so far has not been ready for meaningful talks.

He said that there is a possibility that the Taliban in the future will take over the cities, but the group will not have the capacity to maintain their control.
“I think they are fed up with war, they now realize that they have to look for a political solution,” said Kabulov.
Meanwhile, former Afghan president Hamid Karzai said that reaching a peaceful agreement in Afghanistan requires sincere and honest cooperation from the US and other major powers of the world.

“Taliban at the moment fears to seize control in the major centers,” said Kabulov.
“Until now there are no indications that they are willing to seek a political settlement or to stop violence and destruction,” said MP Sadiq Qaderi.
“The people expect that the enemy stops the violence and realizes the opportunity for peace,” said Latif Mahmoud, deputy spokesman to the president.

“We call on the Taliban and all parties to immediately end the violence, agree to a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire, and engage fully in peace negotiations to end the suffering of the Afghan people,” the embassy said. 
“Pave the way to an inclusive political settlement that benefits all Afghans and ensures that Afghanistan does not again serve as a safe haven for terrorists,” it said. 
This comes as the diplomatic missions to Afghanistan in a joint statement on Monday also called on the Taliban to end the ""ongoing military offensive which thwarts efforts to arrive at a negotiated solution to the conflict and harms and displaces civilians.”  
The statement was issued by the following missions: Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, the EU delegation, Finland, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States.  
“We condemn the continued targeted killings taking place throughout Afghanistan, the destruction of vital infrastructure, and threats, declarations, and other actions against the gains Afghans have made over the last twenty years, gains which we have strongly supported,” it said.   
The statement from the missions also said that the Taliban’s offensive is in direct contradiction to the group's claim to support a negotiated settlement to the conflict and to the Doha peace process.  
“It has resulted in loss of innocent Afghan lives, including through continued targeted killings, displacement of the civilian population, looting and burning of buildings, destruction of vital infrastructure, and damage to communication networks,” the statement said.

“Taliban at the moment fears to seize control in the major centers,” said Kabulov. 
In response to remarks by Kabulov, the Afghan foreign ministry in a statement on Thursday said if Mr. Kabulov has credible information, he should share it with the Afghan government.
The ministry said that the Taliban does not believe in resolving the Afghan crisis politically. 
""If Mr. Kabulov has access to credible information and findings showing that the Taliban's real intention is to resolve the conflict peacefully, share it with us so we can make further progress in the peace process,” it added.

252,US Calls on Taliban to Engage in ‘Serious Negotiations’ | TOLOnews,"The United States has called on the Taliban “to engage in serious negotiations” after the group’s insistence that they will not agree on ceasefire and peace unless there is an agreement on a new government in Afghanistan.
“We call on the Taliban to engage in serious negotiations to determine a political roadmap for Afghanistan's future that leads to a just and durable settlement,” US State Department’s deputy spokesperson Jalina Porter said.
“A negotiated settlement between the Islamic Republic and the Taliban is the only way to end 40 years of war and bring Afghans to peace that they seek and deserve,” she added. 
She said that the world will not accept the imposition by force of a government in Afghanistan, adding that “legitimacy and assistance for any Afghan government can only be possible if that government has a basic right, basic respect excuse me for human rights.”
Porter also underscored that the violence must end against the Afghans who worked alongside Americans in the Afghanistan war.
“Recent reports of violence and atrocities against interpreters and other Afghans indicate local Taliban forces are showing little regard for human life and human rights on the ground,” she said. “We vehemently condemn these targeted attacks, the destruction of vital infrastructure, as well as other attacks against the people of Afghanistan.”
CNN on Friday reported that an Afghan interpreter for US Army was beheaded by the Taliban in May.
“The Taliban must go beyond issuing statements denying territorial offenses and targeted attacks,” Porter said. “If this is truly not Taliban policy, their leadership should condemn these atrocities and violations of basic rights.” 
She said the Taliban “must proactively prevent their forces from carrying out these actions on the ground, reiterating on US’s call for an immediate end to ongoing violence.
This comes as in an interview with The Associated Press, Suhail Shaheen, Taliban spokesman and a member of the group’s negotiating team, said the Taliban will lay down their weapons when a negotiated government acceptable to all sides in the conflict is installed in Kabul and Ghani’s government is gone.

265,Recent Violence Dampens Hopes for Peace: UN Official | TOLOnews,"A senior UN official in Kabul says that the rise in fighting has reduced hopes for peace talks and that the Afghan government and the Taliban should return to the table of negotiations and end the unprecedented violence.
Lisa Reefke, Senior Political Affairs Officer at the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), said that there is a need for international and regional consensus on Afghan peace to achieve results from it.
“The start of the Afghan peace negotiations in September last year generated hopes that talks will create space for Afghans to come together and negotiate a path to peace,” she said at a gathering of women in Kabul. “Today, action on the battlefield seems to compete with the peace negotiations in Doha.”
She added that women’s presence in the peace negotiations is necessary.
“UNAMA remains committed to supporting the parties within its mandate and in cooperation with all Afghans with the region and with the international community to move the peace process forward,” the UN official said.
Women at the event said that at least 57,000 women have invested in various areas in the last 20 years and have created over 130,000 jobs. They highlighted Afghan women’s abilities and said they can play a good role in the peace process.
“Many of these women have created hundreds of jobs for men and women,” said Manizha Wafiq, the chairperson of women’s chamber of commerce and industry.
“They can rarely travel to some provinces and remote villages to keep contact with farmers,” said Karima Sediqqi, the deputy chairperson of the chamber of commerce of women in the western zone of Afghanistan.
The participants of the event said there is a need for a meaningful role for women in any peace process and their achievements should not be compromised.

280,​​​​​​​Taliban Blasted for Attack on Herat City | TOLOnews,"Taliban’s offensive on the city of Herat was criticized by some lawmakers and analysts as a clear violation of their commitments to the Doha agreement, saying it has displaced hundreds of families and has created panic in the western city. 
Under the US-Taliban agreement signed last year in Doha, the Taliban pledged to avoid attacks on major cities.  
“Taliban had pledged not to attack cities, but they increased their offensive in defiance to their commitments,” said Sadiq Qaderi, an MP. 
“If you (Taliban) have got some bravery, where were you the day when the Punjabis entered into the Afghan territory in Spin Boldak?” Hajj and Religious Affairs Minister Mohammad Qasim Halimi said.  
“Cities have been attacked, districts have been attacked, massive casualties have been inflicted to the people,” said Abdul Wadoud Sabit, a political analyst. 
But Taliban has said that the group has no commitment to not attacking major cities. 
A Taliban negotiator, Shahabuddin Dilawar at a press conference in Moscow this month said the group will have any type of military operation in 34 provinces of Afghanistan, including Kabul. 
This comes a day after the Taliban attacked a UN compound in Herat in which a security guard was killed, the organization confirmed. 
Diplomatic offices in Kabul, including the US, UK and Australian embassies as well as NATO’s mission and US National Security Adviser condemned the attack on the UN office. 
The Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs also condemned the Taliban. 
President Ashraf Ghani on Saturday attended a consultative meeting with prominent Afghan political and jihadi leaders, religious scholars, women, and civil society and youth representatives where they expressed their unwavering support for Afghanistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
“These leaders also declared their full support for Afghan Security and Defense Forces in the presence of the country’s security leadership. While stressing the urgency for peace, all agreed that defending Afghanistan is our fundamental right,” Ghani said. 
But the Taliban previously said that they will reduce the violence on the condition that their 7,000 prisoners are released and the names of their leaders are dropped from the UN blacklist.

“Countrywide security should be ensured as the people are tired of the war,” said Fazl Rabi, a Kabul resident.
Hizb-e-Islami leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who is part of a self-proclaimed council to move the talks forward, said that Ashraf Ghani’s failures led to the current situation in the country.
“The corrupt government did not show any preparation to quit violence and to end Afghanistan’s crisis peacefully,” Hekmatyar said in a pre-recorded message on Sunday evening.
Sayed Ishaq Gailani, an Afghan politician who is head of the National Solidarity Party of Afghanistan, said that Afghanistan should have a system in which the achievements of the last two decades are preserved.
“Ashraf Ghani committed treason and he left the country. Now they should be quick in forming their government; otherwise, people will remain concerned,” said Gailani.

The war has intensified in Kandahar, Badakhshan, Ghazni, and Faryab provinces, and residents ask: What are the key politicians and jihadi leaders like Salahuddin Rabani, Mohammad Mohaqeq, Karim Khalili, Abdul Rashid Dostum, Hamid Karzai, and Attah Mohammad Noor Helmand doing to fight the Taliban?
Several citizens and MPs say that key politicians have only supported the government for their own benefits and are now hiding in their homes in Kabul, or they have kept silent while they are out of the country.
“They should be ashamed. If I was in their place, instead of these politicians, I would repent. If you ask people about them, they are not happy,” said Ferdaws, a resident of Kabul.
Another Kabul resident Lal Mohammad said: “They are only fighting for power; they don’t think about people. They ruin people.”
Many Afghan citizens have blamed Afghan politicians for not taking part in the defense of the country and have not commented on the public criticism; however, previously they spoke of supporting the Afghan government and defending it from Taliban attacks if the peace process failed.
“They always act based on their own benefit; they neither have assets here nor are their families living in the country,” MP Khalid Asad said.
“The government should work on such an approach so that politicians could defend their country alongside security forces,” MP Abdaal Allah Mohammadi said.
Meanwhile, the Taliban have taken over parts of Kandahar, including Spin Boldak district, while Tadin Khan, a popular commander in the province is currently in Kabul. He is also a member of the leadership committee of the High Reconciliation Council.
A source close to Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum said that he is currently in Uzbekistan and is planning to travel to Kabul in the upcoming week. The source added that Dostum will go to the north of the country after having a meeting with President Ghani.
Among famous politicians in the country, only Amir Ismail Khan, a former jihadi commander, has taken up arms against the Taliban and is leading the people's mobilization in Herat. Herat residents say he has saved the city from collapse.
Although the Taliban launched a large-scale offensive in Herat over the past week, the mobilization of the people, led by Amir Ismail Khan, has helped government forces to halt the Taliban from taking over the city, sources say.

Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a statement saying that Taliban forces that are advancing in Ghazni, Kandahar, and other Afghan provinces have summarily executed detained soldiers, police, and civilians with alleged ties to the Afghan government.
“Summarily executing anyone in custody, whether a civilian or combatant, is a serious violation of the Geneva Conventions and a war crime,” said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director. “Taliban commanders with oversight over such atrocities are also responsible for war crimes.”
The Taliban denied the allegations.
According to Tadin Khan, the Taliban forcefully took these 900 people from their homes and killed them. 
“They possibly martyred 800 to 900 people in the past month and a half. The people have suffered enormously. The brutality that occurred in Boldak (Spin Boldak district of Kandahar) is unforgivable,” said Tadin Khan.
The HRW statement also said: “Human Rights Watch obtained a list of 44 men from Spin Boldak, Kandahar, whom the Taliban have allegedly killed since July 16. All had registered with the Taliban before being summarily executed. Waheedullah, a police commander from Spin Boldak, had obtained a 'forgiveness' letter from the Taliban, but Taliban fighters took him from his house and executed him on August 2, activists and media monitoring these detentions in Kandahar said."" 
“The civilians who have worked with the government should not be targeted, it is a war crime and a violation of human rights,” said Shahrzad Akbar, the head of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC).
According to the HRW report, the Taliban after taking over the center of Malistan district in Ghazni province began searching house to house ""apparently to identify residents who had worked for the provincial or district government or security forces."" The Taliban ""took into custody dozens of residents, some of whom were later released after being compelled to provide assurances they would not cooperate with the government,"" said Human Rights Watch, adding that the organization ""could not confirm the status or whereabouts of those not released.""
“They killed many civilians,” said MP Arif Rahmani.

Likewise, 12 other (soldiers) were taken hostage by the Taliban. In the second outpost, no resistance occurred and eight soldiers surrendered to the Taliban,” said Hassan Reza Yousufi, member of Ghazni provincial council.

253,33 People Killed in Taliban-held Areas in Kandahar: Watchdog | TOLOnews,"Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) on Saturday said that 33 people were assassinated in Kandahar over the past two weeks.
“Religious scholars, tribal elders, civil society activists, journalists and human rights defenders and female journalists are being sacrificed in targeted attacks,” said Zabihullah Farhang, spokesman to AIHRC.
“Any group that resorts on harming civilians is conducting a war crime under the rules of war,” said Laal Gul Laal, the head of Human Rights Organization.
The Human Rights Watch (HRW), meanwhile, in a report said that hundreds of people in the districts that were fallen to the Taliban in Afghanistan’s southern Kandahar province have been detained and some were killed by the group over their alleged associated with the Afghan government and the country’s security institutions.
The watchdog said that the Taliban have reportedly killed some detainees, including relatives of provincial government officials and members of Afghanistan’s National Police (ANP) and the Afghan National army (ANA).
Citing reports by the journalists, the Human Rights Watch said that after Taliban forces took control of Kandahar’s Spin Boldak border crossing with Pakistan on July 8, and the Spin Boldak district center on July 16, they conducted searches to identify residents who have worked for the local government or security forces.
“Taliban forces that control areas around Kandahar city have carried out similar searches and have evicted some residents. Local media have reported that the Taliban have taken more than 300 people into custody and have detained them in unidentified locations,” HRW said.
“There are grave concerns that Taliban forces in Kandahar may commit further atrocities to retaliate against the government and security forces.” said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Taliban leaders have denied responsibility for any abuses, but growing evidence of expulsions, arbitrary detentions, and killings in areas under their control are raising fears among the population.”
The Taliban have told members of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), including police who have been the principal security force in Kandahar, to register with them to receive letters guaranteeing their safety, the HRW said, quoting a local activist in Kandahar.
According to the report, Taliban forces also gone to the homes of some ANDSF members who had registered, taken them into custody, and killed an unknown number of them.
Local activists said that in one case, on July 9, the Taliban shot and killed a man named Nangiyali, in front of family members. He was a resident of Sarposa, Kandahar, who had previously worked with the police, said HRW.
“The UN, US, and other countries engaged in the peace talks should urgently call on the Taliban leadership to stop these killings and other abuses,” Gossman said.
On Thursday sources familiar with the report said that  Unidentified gunmen reportedly have killed ""over a 100 civilians"" in Spin Boldak district of Kandahar province.
The Afghan Ministry of Interior (MoI) confirmed the report, saying these civilians were killed without any reason.
The Afghan government blamed the Taliban for the murder of civilians.
“The brutal terrorists on the order of their Punjabi bosses (Pakistan) ambushed the homes of the innocent Afghans in certain areas of Spin Boldak, looted the homes and martyred 100 innocent people,” said Mirwais Stanekzai, a spokesman for the Ministry of Interior.
“They must respect intentional laws and the law of war on the battlefields,” said legal expert Qazi Abdul Rahim.
“If revenge continues in this country, they (Taliban) must remember that the nation will retaliate against them,” said former governor of Helmand Amir Mohammad Akhundzada.
The US Department of State has also raised concerns over reports of extrajudicial killings by the Taliban.
“Recent reports of violence and atrocities against interpreters and other Afghan activist indicate local Taliban forces are showing little regard towards human rights and human rights on the ground. We condemns these targeted attacks, the destruction of infrastructure as well as other attacks against the people of Afghanistan,” said Jalina Porter, the deputy State Department spokesperson.
But the Taliban has denied any involvement in human rights violations in areas under their control.

302,UN Envoy Seeks End to Taliban Attacks on Provincial Capitals | TOLOnews,"Seeking an end to the Taliban’s attacks on Afghan provincial capitals, the UN envoy for Afghanistan, Deborah Lyons, on Friday said the UN Security Council should issue a statement against such an attempt by the group as the human toll of this strategy is extremely distressing and the political message is even more deeply disturbing.
Addressing the UN Security Council’s special meeting on Afghanistan’s situation, the UN envoy said Afghanistan is now at a dangerous turning point, adding that ahead lies either a genuine peace negotiation or a tragically intertwined set of crises: an increasingly brutal conflict combined with an acute humanitarian situation and multiplying human rights abuses.
In the past weeks, the war in Afghanistan has entered a new, deadlier, and more destructive phase. The Taliban campaign during June and July to capture rural areas has achieved significant territorial gains. From this strengthened position they have begun to attack the larger cities.
""This is now a different kind of war, reminiscent of Syria recently or Sarajevo in the not-so-distant past. To attack urban areas is to knowingly inflict enormous harm and cause massive civilian casualties,"" she said.
Lyons said that today she focused on the war against cities because a party that was genuinely committed to a negotiated settlement would not risk so many civilian casualties because it would understand that the process of reconciliation will be more challenging the more blood is shed.
 “It would also recognize that they cannot risk the destruction of infrastructure that would be badly needed to rebuild the country once an agreement is reached. It should be made clear to the Taliban political commission that the exemptions to the travel ban and the high protocol with which they have been received by many of the countries were, in fact, predicated on a commitment and progress in the peace process,” she said.
According to her, 40 civilians were killed in Spin Boldak district in Kandahar after it was captured by the Taliban.
In Lashkargah city, the capital of Helmand province, she said that “at least 104 civilians were killed and 403 wounded since July 28.""
“In Kandahar, since the start of the offensive there, on 9 July, a month ago, more than 460 civilian casualties have been registered. Further to the west, in and around Herat, UNAMA has credible reports of over 135 civilian casualties from the onset of the Taliban offensive,” she said.
She said that there have been over 1,000 casualties last month.
Lyons said that despite expectations that the withdrawal of foreign forces would lead to a reduction in violence, but the level of civilian casualties has increased by 50 percent.
“There is a striking contrast between the activity on the battlefield and the quiet stalemate at the negotiation table in Doha—where we should be seeing the opposite: quiet on the battlefield and engagement around the negotiating table,” she said.
The appeal from the UN envoy comes at a time that the Taliban has significantly increased their attacks on Afghan provincial capitals.

315,"Afghanistan: 27 children Killed in Just 3 Days, UN Agency Says | TOLOnews","The UN's agency for children, UNICEF, in a statement on Monday said that 27 children were killed and 136 more were wounded in ongoing fighting in Kandahar, Khost and Paktia provinces in the last 72 hours.
The UN agency said it is ""shocked by the rapid escalation of grave violations against children"" in Afghanistan.
According to the agency, 20 children were killed and 130 more were wounded in Kandahar; 2 children were killed and 3 more were wounded in Khost; 5 children were killed and 3 more were wounded in Paktia in the last 72 hours.
The atrocities grow higher by the day, the agency says.
“These are not numbers. Each one of these deaths and each case of physical suffering is a personal tragedy,” UNICEF envoy in Afghanistan Hervé Ludovic De Lys said in a statement. “These children are much loved and longed-for daughters and sons, brothers and sisters, cousins and friends. All of them are children whose right to protection, under international humanitarian law, has been disregarded by warring parties.”
UNICEF said that these atrocities are also evidence of the ""brutal nature and scale of violence in Afghanistan which preys on already vulnerable children.""
On top of this ""appalling situation,"" UNICEF said, it is also ""deeply concerned about reports that children are, increasingly, being recruited into the conflict by armed groups.""
The agency said that many other boys and girls are deeply traumatized as they witness atrocities committed against their families and others in their communities.
UNICEF said that children should not pay for this worsening conflict with their childhoods and that only a complete end of hostilities can protect Afghanistan’s children.
As long as the conflict rages, children’s ""right to thrive is compromised; their futures jeopardized, and their contributions to their nation’s prospects diminished,"" the agency said.
UNICEF called on all those engaged in mediation efforts to hold the warring parties to their international obligations to children.

337,UN Chief Seeks Immediate End to ‘Taliban Offensive’ | TOLOnews,"The United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Friday asked the Taliban to immediately end its offensive and said seizing power through military forces is a losing proposition.
“I remind all parties of their obligation to protect civilians and I call on the Taliban to immediately end the offensive and return to the peace table,” Guterres said.
“Afghanistan is spinning out of control,” he said. “Every day, the conflict is taking a bigger toll on civilians, especially women and children.”
The UN chief said that in the last month alone, more than 1,000 people have been killed or injured from indiscriminate attacks against civilians, notably in Helmand, Kandahar and Herat provinces. 
“The fighting between the Taliban and Afghan security forces in urban environments is causing tremendous harm. I am also deeply disturbed by early indications that the Taliban are imposing severe restrictions on human rights in the areas under their control, particularly targeting women and journalists,” Guterres said.
He said that it is particularly horrifying and heartbreaking to see reports of the hard-won rights of Afghan girls and women being ripped away from them.
“The message from the international community to those on the warpath must be clear.  Seizing power through military force is a losing proposition. That can only lead to prolonged civil war or to the complete isolation of Afghanistan,” he added.
He called on all parties to take heed of the conflict's heavy toll and its devastating impact on civilians. “They all must do more to protect civilians,” he said.
‘This is the moment to halt the offensive,” the UN chief said. “This is the moment to start serious negotiation. This is the moment to avoid a prolonged civil war or the isolation of Afghanistan.”
This comes as the Taliban seized at least four provincial capitals in less than 24 hours on Thursday and Friday, including the city of Herat in western Afghanistan and Kandahar in the south.

Bachelet said that “at least 183 civilians have been killed and 1,181 injured, including children,” in the cities of Lashkar Gah, Kandahar, Herat and Kunduz since July 9.
“These are just the civilian casualties we managed to document,” she said, adding that “the real figures will be much higher.
The UN official called on parties to the conflict to stop fighting to prevent more bloodshed.
“The Taliban must cease their military operations in cities,” she said. “Unless all parties return to the negotiating table and reach a peaceful settlement, the already atrocious situation for so many Afghans will become much worse.”
Bachelet also urged all States to use their influence – bilaterally and multilaterally – to bring the hostilities to an end.
“States have a duty to use any leverage they have to de-escalate the situation and reinvigorate peace processes. The fighting must be brought to an end,” the UN high commissioner stressed, noting the peace-related meetings taking place this week in Doha. 
According to reports documented by the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and the UN Human Rights Office, most of the civilian harm is being caused by ground engagements. Airstrikes have also resulted in civilian casualties. In addition, since the start of the May Taliban offensive, at least 241,000 people have been displaced, and the protracted fighting in the cities has resulted in damage to essential infrastructure like roads and bridges, and other civilian objects.
In the southern city of Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province, in the 13 days after July 28, when fighting started in the city, the UN received reports of at least 139 civilians killed and 481 injured.
The real numbers are expected to be much higher as communication with the city is intermittently cut off and many civilians wounded by the fighting are unable to reach hospitals. By August 5, hospitals were nearly at full capacity. On July 31 a private clinic was significantly damaged by an Afghan National Army airstrike, leaving one civilian dead and five injured. The available food supply in the city is fast diminishing, said UN reports, and shortages of medical supplies were also reported. Electricity and water were cut off in most parts of the city.
The UN official said that the sweeping takeover of an estimated 192 district administrative centers by the Taliban, the attacks on provincial capitals including Qala-e-Naw, Kandahar, Lashkar Gah, Herat, Faizabad, Ghazni, Maimana, Gardez, Faizabad, Pul-e- Khumri, and Mazar-e-Sharif, and the takeover of at least six provincial capitals - Zaranj in Nimroz province, Sheberghan in Jawzjan province, Kunduz City in Kunduz province, Taluqan in Takhar province, Sar-e-Pul in Sar-e-Pul province and Aybak in Samangan province “have struck fear and dread into the population.”
She warned that the proliferation of pro-government militias being mobilized against the Taliban may also put civilians in additional danger.
In the areas that have already been captured by the Taliban and in contested areas, Bachelet said the Office was receiving reports of summary executions, attacks against current and former government officials and their family members, military use and destruction of homes, schools and clinics, and the laying of large numbers of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), including pressure-plate IEDs which function as anti-personnel landmines.
The UN is also receiving other deeply disturbing reports of serious violations of international humanitarian law such as killings by the Taliban of hors de combat members of Afghan security forces – in some cases after they had even received letters guaranteeing their safety upon surrendering. Orders issued by members of the local Afghan National Police not to spare captured or surrendering Taliban members are also prohibited under international humanitarian law.
Bachelet reminded all parties of their obligation to take all necessary measures to protect civilians, especially when fighting in populated areas. Directing attacks against civilians is a serious violation of international humanitarian law and amounts to a war crime. Perpetrators of serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law must be held accountable, she stressed.
The High Commissioner also expressed particular concern about early indications that the Taliban are imposing severe restrictions on human rights in the areas under their control, particularly targeting women. “People rightly fear that a seizure of power by the Taliban will erase the human rights gains of the past two decades,” she said.
“We have received reports that women and girls in various districts under Taliban control are prohibited from leaving their homes without a Mahram, a male chaperone. These restrictions have a serious impact on the rights of women, including the right to health – and clearly, in the midst of a war, the need to access urgent medical care for themselves and their families is a matter of life and death. Hampering a woman's ability to leave home without a male escort also inevitably leads to a cascade of other violations of the woman's and her family's economic and social rights,” Bachelet warned.
UN office said that in several locations, the Taliban have reportedly threatened that violation of these rules would result in harsh punishments. There are already reports of women having been flogged and beaten in public because they breached the prescribed rules. In one case in Balkh province, on August 3, a women's rights activist was shot and killed for breaching the rules.
Serious curbs on the freedom of expression and the ability of journalists to do their crucial work by both parties are also of deep concern during this time of uncertainty and chaos, the High Commissioner said.
“The people of Afghanistan are speaking of their deep fears of a return to the worst of the human rights violations of the past,” Bachelet said. “Women, minorities, human rights defenders, journalists as well as others who are particularly vulnerable need particular protection. There are very real risks of renewed atrocities against ethnic and religious minorities.”
“We will continue to monitor the human rights situation, in spite of security and other challenges, and I urge the international community, including through the Human Rights Council and the Security Council, to take urgent action to prevent further atrocities and to ensure that civilians in Afghanistan do not – once again – have to bear the brunt, and aftermath, of a prolonged and deadly conflict,” she concluded.

Two landmines exploded in Kandahar province--one in Panjwai and the other in Maiwand district--killing seven civilians and wounding three others.
A landmine blast, remote-controlled, in the town of Sardawra in the northern province of Kunduz, killed two people, including a child, and injured 14 others, most of them children.
The blast in the city of Kunduz occurred just hours after the Eid prayers.
A Kunduz resident said: “The security forces arrived in the area 40 minutes after the accident occurred, while the Kunduz police headquarters is only 100 meters away from the incident area.”
“A Muslim does never oppress another Muslim in this way. We grow our children in poverty and miserable conditions, but they become victims very easily. If they (perpetrators) are Muslims, they should never commit such an atrocity against children,” said another resident of Kunduz province.
Officials in the Kunduz Provincial Hospital said the injured patients are in a critical state.
“Unfortunately, 16 people, who were injured and martyred in the explosion, were taken to the hospital,” said Fahim Hussainzada, a physician in Kundoz’s provincial hospital.
Meanwhile, in Kandahar province, two roadside mines exploded in Panjwai and Maiwand districts, killing seven civilians and wounding three others.
“At 9:30 a.m. today a landmine exploded on a taxi, carrying civilians, in Panjwai district. The mine was placed by the Taliban,” said Jamal Barakzai, spokesman for the Kandahar police chief.
In the past week, and before the government and the Taliban declared a 3-day ceasefire on Eid al-Fitr, more than a dozen provinces were witnessing heavy clashes between the fighters from the two sides.
Kabul, Kandahar, Helmand, Herat, and Balkh are the provinces that were least secure in the past week.

5,Taliban Mounts 141 Attacks in 24 Hours: Sources | TOLOnews,"The Taliban conducted 141 attacks over the last 24 hours, mostly in Uruzgan, Zabul, Kandahar, Nangarhar, Badakhshan and Takhar provinces, sources said.

But the Defense Ministry said that the Taliban’s casualties were more than 100 in the last 24 hours. The Taliban rejected this figure. 
 
Data collected by TOLOnews shows that 438 members of Afghan forces and civilians were killed and more than 500 others were wounded in the last 30 days. The data shows that 190 bombings, targeted attacks and offensives happened in the last month. 
 
A reliable source meanwhile reported a Taliban attack on an outpost on the outskirts of Pul-e-Khumri city in Baghlan province. Sources said that three members of the police special unit were killed in the attack.

Referring to this attack, US and NATO forces commander in Afghanistan Gen. Scott Miller said: “A return to violence would be one senseless and tragic. But make no mistake, we have the military means to respond forcefully to any type of attacks against the coalition and the military means to support the Afghan security forces. That would be a mistake to move in that direction.” 
 
“Security forces are in a better position,” said Fawad Aman, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense. “The Taliban is faced with defeat on the battlefield and all their focus is on harming civilians.”

67,Security Agencies: ANDSF Fighting Taliban in 104 Districts | TOLOnews,"The Afghan National Security and Defense Forces (ANDSF) are currently fighting the Taliban in 104 provinces, the Afghan security agencies said on Tuesday, noting a 7 percent increase compared to the same period last year.
Reflecting on the numbers of Taliban attacks across the country, Ahmad Zia Saraj, the head of the Afghan intelligence agency—the National Directorate of Security (NDS)--said that the militant group has launched 3,500 attacks since the start of the year. 
Hayatullah Hayat, the acting minister of interior, said that the current war in Afghanistan is part of a propaganda effort of regional players, and stated that the Afghan National Police (ANP) is determined to support the ANA in repelling Taliban attacks.
On Tuesday, Afghanistan’s Meshrano Jirga—the upper house of Parliament--summoned the heads of Afghanistan’s security agencies to inquire about the security situation in the country.
Senators expressed surprise over the situation in some provincial capitals.
“There is a problem in the policy-making, there are management issues and nepotism and political issues facing the country’s security and defense forces which are creating major problems for us,” said Mohammad Alam Ezedyar, the deputy head of the Meshrano Jirga.
“The Taliban made their way very easily to the prison in Baghlan, they also reached Helmand and Baghlan--the head of NDS is here, we should have preemptive measures,” said senator Rahmatullah Achakzai.
“Why haven't you taken these measures before? Why don’t you have a proper plan against the enemies?” asked Senator Mualim Lalagul.
“The war has increased during the spring and everyone knows about it, our assessments indicate that there is a seven percent increase in the Taliban’s war,” said Hayatullah Hayat, the acting Minister of Interior.
“Your security and defense forces are very determined and prepared, the enemy has suffered massive casualties and they do not have more strength,” said Ahmad Zia Saraj, the head of NDS.
“Regional intelligence and our enemies are spreading propaganda suggesting that parts here and there in Afghanistan are collapsing; this calculation is totally wrong,” said Hayatullah Hayat.
“Nothing has changed in Pakistan’s intentions, so what is our duty? We should settle our internal problems. We must empower ourselves and this will prevent Pakistan’s interference,” said Ahmad Zia Saraj, the head of the NDS.
Acting Minister of Interior Hayatullah Hayat meanwhile said that regional intelligence agencies are behind the current war in Afghanistan, and he confirmed his ministry’s commitment to supporting the Afghan army in the fight against the militants.
“What were the factors that led to the collapse of checkpoints in Laghman? Why did you (security agencies) not provide support to the soldiers while they were appealing for assistance during the fall of Dawlat Shah district,” said Gul Mari Laghmani, a member of the Afghanistan parliament.
“What were the reasons and the factors behind the sudden security turbulence in Laghman? Isn’t there good coordination between the local administration? Or the center is not focusing on the issue? You must know about it,” said Mir Hatam Tarahkhel.
According to the local officials in Baghlan, recent battles have left 15,000 people homeless in Baghlan province.
“Over 15,000 families have been displaced and this is a large number, and the figures are increasing,” said Sharifullah Shafaq, the head of Baghlan's migration department.
“Baghlan and Laghman are both facing security threats, there are some other factors behind the security challenges, we are closely working on the issue; until now we have managed to prevent the conspiracy,” said Hayatullah Hayat, the acting Minister of Interior, referring to proxy interests behind the fighting. 
“There was a bombardment. I live around this clinic, which is destroyed now, nothing is left for us,” said Sher Azam, a resident of Baghlan-e-Markazi district.
“We evacuated and left all our belongings behind, all the people become displaced,” said Mohammad Ishaq, a resident of Baghlan.
Last month the Afghan Ministry of Refugees and Repatriations said that the two months of war had displaced over 8,000 families in northern Afghanistan.
Laghman, Kunduz, Baghlan, Helmand and Kandahar have all recently witnessed battles between the Afghan security forces and the Taliban.
Saraj meanwhile criticized Pakistan’s continued interference in Afghanistan’s affairs and called on the Afghan people to mobilize in order to face the country's current challenges.
In recent weeks the Taliban has launched major offensives in at least five districts across various provinces and seized control.

Sources from Kandahar on Friday said that the Taliban attacked District 7 of the city of Kandahar and captured two outposts.

Taliban negotiator Shahabuddin Delawar, who is in Moscow with two other members of the group, said that they will not attack cities to prevent bloodshed.

Delawar said they are in talks with other Afghans to discuss a new system ""that should be Islamic, Afghan-inclusive and united.""
He added that they have “85% of Afghan soil under their control.”
According to him, they have over 250 districts in Afghanistan under their control and over 170 of them have been taken over in the last two months.
In response to a question whether they will favor a return of Taliban’s emirate, Delawar said that the issue will be decided upon in the intra-Afghan peace negotiations.
He said that all Afghan border towns taken over by the Taliban will remain active. He vowed to address traders' problems.
The Taliban members sought to signal that they did not pose a threat to the wider region however.
They said the Taliban will do all it could to prevent Daesh operating on Afghan territory and that it will also seek to wipe out drug production.
“We will take all measures so that Daesh will not operate on Afghan territory,” Delawar said. “Our territory will never be used against our neighbors.”

286,Justice Minister Accuses Taliban of War Crimes | TOLOnews,"Justice Minister Fazel Ahmad Manawi on Monday said the Taliban is guilty of war crimes for torturing and killing war hostages. He said the group is not committed to adhering to any international laws or humanitarian norms. 
Manawi said that all crimes against humanity committed by the Taliban should be assessed at the national and international levels.
A video circulating on social media shows Taliban militants killing an army commander after he is arrested by the group.
Specifically, the video shows the moment when Colonel Abdul Hamid Hamidi, the commander of the 1st Regiment of the Afghan Army’s 207 Zafar Corps in Herat, is taken captive. Security officials said the colonel was arrested with five of his soldiers and then he was shot and killed.
“What is done by the Taliban is a violation of human rights, a violation of international law and is an international crime and humanitarian crime,” Manawi said.
A watchdog organization said that it has registered many such incidents of war crimes committed by the Taliban.
“Shooting captives is against the law and is a crime under national and international laws as well as under Sharia law,” said Mohammad Ayub Yusufzai, a member of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission.
The Taliban did not comment on the matter.
Another video that has been confirmed by a Taliban spokesman shows two people killed after a guilty verdict by a kangaroo court for charges of robbery.
“They want to cause horror among the people to the extent that people are afraid of them,” said Injila Rahil, the deputy chairperson of the lawyers' union.
President Ashraf Ghani, who attended a special session of the houses of Parliament on Monday said the Taliban has become crueler compared to the past.
“Talib attacks are more violent, more bloodthirsty and more oppressive,” Ghani said.
Back in June, 23 members of an Afghan special force unit were executed by the Taliban in Faryab province after they surrendered to the group. Moreover, a famous comedian, Mohammad Khasha Zwan, was killed in Kandahar after he was taken captive by the group late last month.

Aziza, Khasha’s wife, said that the Taliban entered their house and ignored even the scream of his small daughter to spare his life.
She said that the Taliban killed Khasha only two hours after his arrest.
Khasha’s wife is now responsible for their six children. 
She said the family does not have 2,000 Afs to pay the rent for the house.
“The children say 'we want to see our father,' they were pushed back by (the Taliban),” said Aziza.
“What can I say to the Taliban? May God punish them,” said Aziza.
“I asked my father, 'what you did that the Taliban are here for you?' and he said: 'I have done nothing,' said Wakil Ahmad, Khasha’s son.
“My father was trying to bring a smile to the face of the people, I was devastated when I saw the killing of my father,” said Noor Ahmad, Khasha’s son.
Previously the Taliban spokesman told TOLOnews that Khasha Zuwan was a member of the Afghan police and that the comedian had insulted the Taliban.
The Taliban spokesman said that the group will investigate the way Khasha was murdered.
Khasha’s family has denied he had any links to the police. His family said that Khasha was performing for the security forces to earn money.

Meanwhile, the US State Department has said that Washington was assessing to find out whether the Taliban is willing to end the conflict through a diplomatic solution or insists on the military takeover of Afghanistan.
""We're looking very carefully at the situation on the ground in Afghanistan, and we're also looking very hard at whether the Taliban is at all serious about a peaceful resolution to the conflict. We continue to be engaged in diplomacy, but actions that would try to take the country by force are of course totally inconsistent with finding a peaceful resolution,” said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
Recent clashes have displaced many families in various provinces. 
“A mortar landed. Several people were wounded and martyred,” said Bashir Ahmad, a wounded person in Kunduz.
Sources have told TOLOnews that a vehicle belonged to public uprising forces in Shinwari district was attacked in Dara-e-Ghorband in which three of these forces were killed and nine others were wounded.

“We have cleared those areas that had fallen to the enemy. We are ready to redeploy our forces,” Faryab police chief Ghaibullah Sadat said.

163,Pakistan Won’t Take Military Action against Afghan Taliban: Khan | TOLOnews,"Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Friday that his country will not take military action against the Taliban if the group takes over Afghanistan by force.
Quoted in an article by The New York Times, Khan said that “Pakistan will only recognize a government which is chosen by the people of Afghanistan, whichever government they choose.”
“Let me assure you, we will do everything except use military action against the Taliban,” Khan replied when asked what Pakistan would do if the Taliban took over Afghanistan by force. “I mean, we will do everything up to that. All sections of our society have decided that Pakistan will take no military action.”
“Now, we are fencing it, and almost 90 percent of the border, we’ve fenced now,” Khan said. “What if [the] Taliban try to take over Afghanistan through [the] military? Then we will seal the border because now we can, because we have fenced our border, which was previously [open], because Pakistan does not want to get into, number one, conflict, secondly, we do not want another influx of refugees.”
Khan said that after the US withdrawal, he wished that Pakistan and the US could fix their “lopsided” equation of the past. 
The remarks come as violence remains high in the country following a sharp rise in the Taliban’s offensives against government forces. Afghan forces retook the control of seven districts from the Taliban in three provinces in the last 24 hours.

120,Attacking Polio Vaccinators Means Children Will Suffer: MoPH | TOLOnews,"The Afghan Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), referring to the killing of at least five polio vaccinators in the eastern province of Nangarhar, on Wednesday said that the attack on health workers, including the polio vaccinators, will cause the paralysis of more children in Afghanistan.
The health ministry said that security threats in the past years have deprived nearly 3.5 million children of polio vaccination.
“Can I take back my brother in exchange for 300 Afs? What should I do now, what should I do with this govt,” said the brother of one of the victims.
“There have been no proper security measures for the vaccinators, the vaccinators implement polio to both parties (govt and Taliban areas),” said Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for Nangarhar governor.
The recent attack on polio vaccinators in Nangarh marks the second deadly attacks on them in the past two months.
“49 children were infected with the poliovirus in the past six months, when we compare this with the statistics that we recorded from last year, they look like similar figures,” said Dastagir Nazari, a spokesman to MoPH.
“The government has a responsibility to provide secuity for those who serve the people, including the doctors and those performing the vaccination,” said Robina Jalali, an MP.

85,"Taliban Control Key Dam in Kandahar, Farmers Plead for Water | TOLOnews","Dahla Dam, a main irrigation source for surrounding areas in Kandahar, continues to remain under Taliban control for the past month.
The Dahla Dam is one of the main water sources providing water to agricultural land in seven districts in the province. But the Taliban's control of the dam has deprived farmers of irrigation water.
Farmers in Kandahar said their gardens and agricultural lands will be devastated if swift action is not taken to continue the flow of water.
The Taliban said that irrigation experts are allowed to come and regulate the water distribution from the dam to the farmers' fields. But the Afghan government has said that it plans to launch an operation to clear the area from Taliban control.
Lands in Arghandab, Shah Wali Kot, Zhari, Maiwand, Panjwayi, Daman and Dand districts are dependent on the water that flows from the Dahla Dam. 
“Water is the blessing of God and we are Muslims, why is the government closing the dam, why are they destroying the country?"" asked Hairan, a farmer in Kandahar.
“It is now the season of growth of pomegranates, if water does not come, they will be affected,” said Kandahar farmer Abdul Raziq.
“The operation moves forward in a good way, our forces will soon get their objectives,” said Ghorzang Afridi, the head of the security department at Kandahar police headquarters.
“It's natural for the enemy to destroy the things that are in the interest of the people, but our security forces are defending them with full dignity and courage,” said Abdul Matin Hussainkhel, the commander of 205 Shaheen Army Corps.

188,MoI to Probe Govt Forces Withdrawal from Districts' Centers | TOLOnews,"Afghanistan’s Ministry of Interior Affairs (MoI) will probe recent evacuations by government forces from the centers of various districts across the country.
Over the last two months, the Taliban has taken over dozens of districts across Afghanistan, raising strong criticisms among the public and analysts who are citing poor leadership and mismanagement of the war as key reason that the Taliban has taken over large swaths of land in the country.
Reports say that in some districts as instances in Shireen Tagab and Pashtun Kot and Qaisar districts of Faryab, and Qarabagh and Muqur districts of Ghazni, hundreds of security force members surrendered to the Taliban without any resistance.
“There is speculation that the security forces were asked not to fight, but it is not confirmed who said this,” said MP Khan Agha Rezaee.
In the past two months Taliban has taken control of more than 120 districts.
“Investigation is underway to find out the main reason,” said Gen. Abdul Sattar Mirzakwal, the acting minister of interior.
Referring to the factors behind the evacuations, the Ministry of Defense said that lack of equipment and delay in the delivery of emergency assistance to the security forces are among the factors that have led to the problem.
“We evacuated some areas in order to prevent casualties among civilians and military personnel, and to prevent the damage to residential areas and delay in on time delivery of supplies to our personnel,” said Rohullah Ahmadzai, spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.
Rahmatullah Nabil, the former head of Afghan intelligence agency, said that the Taliban is seeking to takeover some strategic and important areas.
“The Taliban want to expand fighting in central provinces and to take control over the supply routes to Kabul and then go to the negotiating table where they will make major demands, and if their demands not met, they will focus on other objectives they seek,” said Nabil.
Taliban significantly increased their offensive after foreign troops started withdrawal from Afghanistan.

169,Hundreds More Take Up Arms as Clashes Intensify | TOLOnews,"As clashes continue and intensify, hundreds more have taken up arms against the Taliban in support of the government forces, this time in Herat, Patkia, Ghor and Kunduz provinces.
Those who took up arms said they will not allow their villages to fall to the Taliban who they claim would damage the country’s infrastructure. 
So far, hundreds of people have taken up arms against the Taliban in Takhar, Balkh, Badghis, Baghlan, Nangarhar, Laghman, Jawzjan, Samangan and Kapisa provinces. 
People in over 10 districts have taken up arms against the Taliban in just a week following the back-to-back fall of dozens of districts to the group.  
Sources said that since Saturday evening, five districts fell to the Taliban – including Sayed Abad and Chak-e-Wardak in Maidan Wardak, Rustaq in Takhar, Arghistan in Kandahar and Shortepa in Balkh. 
During this period, the government forces have had some progress but have not reported recapturing any district. 
“Paktia residents pledge to the government and the security agencies that we are with you,” said Abdul Mallik Zazai, head of the provincial council in Paktia. 
Some residents of Enjil district in Herat who have taken up arms warned the Taliban to quit violence or they will face resistance from the people. 
“We pledge to the people that we will defend the country until the last drop of our blood,” Farid Ahmad, a public uprising force member. 
In Ghor and Kunduz as well, people say they have been left with no option but to take up arms to fight the Taliban.
“We will suppress the Taliban wherever they are. We will always support our security forces,” said Abdul Rahman, a Ghor resident who has taken up arms. 
“We prevented the enemy from advancing. And we are supporting the government,” said Khalid, a Kunduz resident who has taken up arms. 
Some politicians said that arming the people is a serious need given the current situation and they welcome this move, but they expressed their concerns about its consequences if the forces are not managed well. 
“Those who lead these forces should be responsible so that when the fighting is over they will not create any problems for Afghanistan,” said Asadullah Saadati, the deputy head of the High Council for National Reconciliation. 
The Presidential Palace said recent moves in the last few weeks are in favor of the Republic. 
“The people of Afghanistan, by supporting the security and defense forces and the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, joined the united umbrella of the Republic,” presidential spokesman Latif Mahmoud said. 
The Ministry of Defense assured that the activities of the public forces will be well managed. 
“The mobilization of the people in support of the security and defense forces has had a considerable role in retaking territories, especially in the north, and has prevented the fall of some areas,” Defense Ministry spokesman Fawad Aman said. 
The Taliban called those who have taken up arms “Arbakis” and warned that they will not be forgiven.

268,ONSC Criticized for Last Year's District Police Appointments | TOLOnews,"The head of the defense affairs committee in Parliament said that one of the reasons for the fall of districts to the Taliban is the unprofessional management and selection of police commanders for the districts.
This comes a day after the head of the Parliament’s internal security commission accused the Office of the National Security Council (ONSC) of incompetence, saying interference by the ONSC in the affairs of the country’s security agencies is complicating the war effort on the battlefield.
Last year the Office of the National Security Council (ONSC) announced the appointment of 100 commanders for the districts.
The ONSC at the time said that the move was to improve the security situation in those districts which were not stable from a security perspective.
But the head of Parliament’s defense commission said that the fall of the districts to the Taliban is related to mismanagement by these police commanders in the districts.
Meanwhile, a number of security analysts said that the appointment of police commanders is the authority of the Ministry of Interior and no other organ including the ONSC has the right to interfere there.
President Ashraf Ghani at the time publically welcomed the appointments made by the ONSC.
“There will be a management system, a motivation, a commitment and a movement and the Afghan nation will remember it with pride in their history,” said Ghani at the time.
“We want you to act with seriousness, we want you to show that when a powerful leader goes to a district, then he is able to change the entire situation,” said Hamdullah Mohib, National Security Adviser.
However, Parliament’s defense commission said that the appointment was full of shortcomings.
“The way they were recruited was not right; if we were looking to bring reforms, we had people in the police ranks to be replaced and the situation could be much better than it is now,” said Mir Haidar Fazli, the head of Parliament’s defense commission.
Dawlat Abad district in Faryab, Jalga and Nahrain districts in Baghlan, Khan Abad district in Kunduz, Jurm and Shaghnan districts in Badakhshan, Darqad district in Takhar, Siah Gard district in Parwan, Ab Band district in Ghazni are among the districts that have fallen to the Taliban. These districts were among the 100 districts for which the ONSC announced new police commanders last year.
“The status of police commanders is clearly written in the law, which is approved through a board by the Ministry of Interior. Regarding this issue, the Office of the National Security Council does not have any authority and it cannot interfere there,” said Mirza Mohammad Yarmand, former deputy minister of interior.
“From a legal perspective, it (ONSC) does not have the authority to do so—they have defined authority in their own way and there is no one above them to ask why,” said Sayed Eshaq Gailani, the head of Nahzat-e-Hambastagi Milli Afghanistan party.
Why did the ONSC make the decision?
“We had high-level security threats during those days in 128 districts, there was a thought at the time to use the police structure too towards tackling the war in the districts,” said Rafi Fazel, the technical deputy of the ONSC.
The criticism comes as the Taliban has taken over 200 districts following the announcement of the withdrawal of US forces.

308,Afghans Question Govt’s Security Strategy amid Taliban Advances | TOLOnews,"Ordinary Afghans and critics on Saturday strongly criticized the Afghan government’s security strategy as the Taliban take over two provincial capitals within the span of only two days.
They said that the so-called public uprising forces have not played any crucial role in repulsing the Taliban’s military advancement towards major cities and strategic locations.
Footage on social media shows dozens of Afghan security forces along with their military equipment and vehicles are driving towards the border with Iran, leaving Zaranj city, the center of Nimroz province in southwestern Afghanistan, without any resistance.
“Poor leadership and lack of coordination in the past several years have led to this crisis,” said MP Khaled Assad.
“I call on our people not be deceived by empty promises in the future,” Wali, a resident in Kunduz said.
Soon after their emergence a month ago, the public uprising forces were expected to help the Afghan government forces in their campaign against the Taliban.
But critics said that the battle in Sheberghan showed that the public uprising forces did not accomplish their tasks contrary to what was expected from them. Critics said that in Sheberghan, only the son of Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum and his loyal forces resisted against the Taliban.
“Where are these leaders who were raising their voice for posts and seats,” said Salim Sahel, a resident of Kabul.
A spokesman for Dostum meanwhile said that the government did not deliver sufficient equipment in Sheberghan to help the public uprising forces to fight the Taliban.
“Public uprising forces so far have not received the support of the central government and today we see the fall of Sheberghan city,” said Abdul Kabir Haidari, a member of National Islamic Movemnet of Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, Marshal Dostum met with President Ashraf Ghani to discuss the overall security situation in the north.
“The main proposal of Marshal Dostum was the implementation of martial law in Afghanistan. The president today welcomed this suggestion,” said Ehsan Nairo, a spokesman to Dostum.
Three days back, President Ghani said that he has ordered the number of special operation forces to increase to to 45,000.
“The recruitment process of new commandos both from within the security forces and outside the structure of the security forces has started,” said Fawad Aman, a Defense Ministry spokesman.
Currently, around 20,000 officers are serving within the ranks of the Special Operation Forces.

Addressing a gathering in Khost province, Ghani asked the nation to stay united in support for independence, the republic and coexistence.
“The Taliban is responsible for the continuation of the war,” Ghani said. “Taliban should be asked whom they are fighting for? Who will benefit if Afghanistan is ruined and if Afghans are killed?”
Defense Ministry said that 191 Taliban fighters were killed in Afghan forces operations in different parts of the country in the last 24 hours. Taliban has rejected the figures.

“They wanted to take over Zakhel, Khakani areas, as well as, District 3,” said Haji Mohammad, Commander of the 2nd Division of Afghan Commando Unit in north.

313,Govt Criticized for Fall of Strategic Areas in North | TOLOnews,"Lawmakers from Kunduz and Jawzjan strongly blasted the government, accusing it of not paying sufficient attention to the situation in the north as the Taliban gain control of strategic areas, including Jawzjan's provincial capital Sheberghan and parts of Kunduz city in Kunduz province.
They said other cities in the north are currently threatened.
“The situation in Kunduz affects the situation in Takhar and Baghlan. And is an important location,” said Mirza Mohammad Yarmand, the former deputy minister of interior.
“The Taliban was focused on Kunduz as an important location but the government saw it as a small village,” said Rabbani Rabbani, a member of Kunduz's provincial council.
A group of Kunduz residents held a rally in front of the Presidential Palace on Sunday, criticizing a lack of support for troops in the province.
“Our people have no shelter. Those who are in Kabul have no place to live. Others have been caught there. Some have been killed and wounded,” said Jawad Rafat, a Kunduz resident who attended a rally in Kabul.
“Kunduz is called the 'little Afghanistan' because it houses all respected ethnic groups. Now they have concentrated the power with one team or group,” said Amruddin Wali, the head of the Kunduz provincial council.
Meanwhile, some members of the National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan (Junbish-e-Milli) said that more cities in the north will come under threat if the Taliban advances are not prevented in Kunduz. 
“The issue is there was a rivalry between Marshal Dostum and others--some who did not want Junbish joined the Taliban; otherwise the Taliban would not have had the ability to overrun Jawzjan,” said Bahruddin Jawzjani, a tribal elder from Jawzjan.
“If the government does not start an operation, it will have a negative impact on all the northern and northeastern provinces,” said Halima Sadaf Karimi, an MP from Jawzjan.  
As concerns grow about the country’s situation, government officials have spoken about President Ghani’s security plan, but the details of the plan have not yet been made public. According to the Presidential Palace, President Ghani has discussed the plan in his recent meetings with a number of political leaders.

111,ANDSF Retakes 2 Districts as Fighting Intensifies | TOLOnews,"Amid a sharp rise in fighting, Afghan forces have retaken two districts in the north in the last five days. However, other districts continue to fall to the Taliban.
Khan Abad district in Kunduz was retaken on Monday and Chah Ab district in Takhar was retaken last week.
Meanwhile, security forces reported that they evacuated the center of Sayyad district in the northern province of Sar-e-Pul and Oba district in the western province of Herat.
Figures collected by TOLOnews reveal that centers of at least 30 districts have fallen to the Taliban in less than two months.
“Over 50 militants were killed in face-to-face fighting and by airstrikes in Khan Abad. Some commanders are also among them,” said Kunduz Police Chief Farid Mashal.
Oba district in Herat; Shahrak, Tolak and Saghar districts in Ghor; Posht and Lash o Joyan districts in Farah; Jawand and Murghab districts in Badghis; Dawlat Abad district and Qaisar districts in Faryab; Sayyad and Sozma Qala districts in Sar-e-Pul; Burka district in Baghlan; Ishkamish district in Takhar; and Zari district in Balkh are among the 30 districts that have fallen to militants during this period, according to TOLOnews findings.
“The root causes of why districts started to fall suddenly should be determined. Some districts were handed over to the Taliban in the west without resistance and their equipment was left for militants,” said Sadiq Qaderi, an MP from Herat.
Centers of the following districts are among those captured by the Taliban: Washir district in Helmand; Arghistan district in Kandahar; Shinkai and Arghandab districts in Zabul; Chinarto and Gezab districts in Uruzgan; Dob and Mandol districts in Nuristan; Arghanjkhwah district in Badakhshan; Deh Yak, Jaghato, Rashidan and Ab Band districts in Ghazni; Charkh district in Logar; Narkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak; and Dawlat Shah districts in Laghman.
“Districts are falling every day. Nothing changes then. They announce they have retreated. What does this mean? Kabul will fall and they will say that they have retreated,” said Rohullah, a Kabul resident.
“People are worried. Kabul might fall if the collapse of districts continues,” said Hashemi, a Kabul resident.
First Vice President Amrullah Saleh said that the recent advancements by the Taliban are narrow and that this narrow line of the Taliban “will soon be changed into a graveyard” for the group.
“In many areas that have been called a 'collapse,' Talib, by creating a narrow line, has progressed. Their sequence has no depth or width. Those who are familiar with the fight against Talib know that this narrow line will turn into a mass grave for this group of horror and ignorance,” Saleh said in a Facebook post. 
“There are areas in districts where we made retreats. New forces were sent, they were equipped and the enemy will soon be removed from there,” Defense Ministry spokesman Rohullah Ahmadzai said. 
“Tactical and operational initiatives are rare. They should bring in new methods. Districts should be helped by their neighboring districts if they are attacked,” said former deputy minister of interior, Mirza Mohammad Yarmand.
At least 40 security force members have been either killed or wounded in clashes over the past 24 hours, but the Defense Ministry said Taliban casualties are higher than those of the government forces. 
The Taliban has rejected figures provided by the ministry.

The attacks happened in Dara-e-Farokh Shah and Dara-e-Kalan areas in Nijrab district, Kapisa police spokesman Shayiq Shorish said.

Complaints included the alleged failure of Afghan forces to fight in an offensive mode, and for failing to supply provisional outposts.
The centers of Jaghato and Band Ab districts in Ghazni, and Dawlat Abad district in Faryab, have fallen to the Taliban in the last 24 hours, according to provincial council members and local sources. However, the Defense Ministry has said that these areas were ""evacuated"" or that security forces ""retreated to protect civilians.""
Sources said that 17 districts have fallen to the Taliban in the last two months.

“It has been proven that being on the defensive is not active. The government should change the method of war and should go into an offensive mode, rather than defensive,” said Hayatullah Elmi, an MP from Samangan.
Former interior minister Gen. Massoud Andarabi said there is a need to pay more attention to the peace process at this critical juncture.
“If we put everything on the security sector, it will be difficult for them to get out of the situation,” Andarabi said.
Ordinary Afghans commented that the government has failed to provide support to security forces in some areas.
“Twenty districts have fallen but the government is silent and is not addressing anything. We call on the government to find a fundamental solution,” said Mir Salamuddin, a Kabul resident.
“The government does not have a plan for our security forces who are martyred every day,” said Mohammad Kabir, a Kabul resident.
Sources from security agencies said Taliban casualties on the battlefield are higher than those of Afghan forces, but some sources tell TOLOnews that the security forces casualties are nearly 100 each day.

“The Taliban has failed in their attempts in Jawand district,” said Hassamuddin Shams, the provincial governor. “equipment has been provided to the security forces in the past two weeks and there are enough security forces. Also, the residents support the security forces in fighting the Taliban.” 
In Herat, Pashton Zarghon, Zenda Jan and Kohsan districts also witnessed attacks by the Taliban in the past two days, according to local officials. 
“We have warned the government that the outcome of this would be bad and the insecurity in the district is threatening the security of Herat city,” said Wakil Ahmad Karokhi, a member of the provincial council. 
Civilians have been harmed in the fighting in the western parts of the country.  
During recent attacks in Badghis, at least 11 civilians--including women and children--were killed in a roadside mine blast. 
No group including the Taliban has claimed responsibility for the blast.

235,Republic-Taliban Talks in Doha Continue for 2nd Day | TOLOnews,"The talks between high-ranking delegations from the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban continued for the second day in Qatar and focused on key demands of both sides.
Abdullah Abdullah, head of the High Council for National Reconciliation, who chairs the Republic team in the talks said he expects a “positive and constructive” outcome from the talks.
Sources familiar with the matter said that in this latest round the Taliban has insisted on the release of 7,000 prisoners and the removal of its leaders’ names from the UN blacklist, and the Republic delegation has emphasized the need for a roadmap for peace in Afghanistan.
The meeting between the 7-member Republic team led by Abdullah Abdullah, and the 7-member Taliban delegation led by Abdul Ghani Baradar, the deputy leader of the group, was held behind closed doors.
“The presence of a mediator in the negotiations, political participation and other matters were the main topics of discussion,” said the reconciliation council’s spokesman Fraidoon Khwazoon. “Today, too, the negotiations will continue and we will issue a statement at the end.”
The State Ministry for Peace Affairs said an effort will be made to find ways to expedite peace efforts.
“We expect that as a result of these talks the Taliban will stop the massacre of the people and show an active presence at the negotiating table,” said Mohammad Amiri, a presidential spokesman.
Taliban leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada in an Eid message on Sunday emphasized the need for a political solution to the Afghan crisis.
He mentioned the Taliban's takeover of districts but said the group's support for a political solution is ""serious.""
“The Taliban does not see consensus within the government. They don’t see a clear plan. Back in Kabul, there is a lack of clear plan. This is where the Taliban can gain more advantage (in the talks),” said Abdul Ahad Sar Tayyib, an analyst.
“Based on the knowledge I have about the Taliban, I don’t think the Doha meeting will have an outcome,” said Zahir Salangi, an MP from Parwan.
Hibatullah’s message reads that the two sides are still wasting the opportunity for peace. He reiterates that the Taliban is committed to freedom of speech within the framework of Islamic orders and national interests of the country. He asks journalists to adjust their activities based on these two points.
But the acting minister of information and culture, Qasim Wafaeezada, said on Sunday that some radio stations have changed to a “tool for Taliban propaganda” in areas under their influence.
“You know and have information that Maiwand Radio in Shindand (district in Herat) has changed into radio sharia and only airs Taliban’s messages,” he said. “Radio Paiman in Baghlan, Radio Sima-e-Solkh in Samangan, Radio Nawbahar in Balkh, Radio Jaihoon in Kunduz are the networks that with the arrival of Taliban, their female workers have been dismissed, their activities have been prevented, and have turned into Taliban radio by putting pressure on them,” he said.
Akhundzada has pledged that the Taliban will work to protect embassies, foreign organizations and investors. He has said that no one will be allowed to pose threat to other countries from Afghanistan.

152,130 Taliban Members Join Peace Process in Herat: Officials | TOLOnews,"A group of 130 Taliban members laid down their weapons and joined the peace process in the western province of Herat on Thursday morning, local officials said. 
The group was active in the Zer-e-Koh district of Herat province, according to officials.
Mardan Noorzai, the leader of the group, said that “with the withdrawal of foreign forces from the country, the time of jihad is over, and we will no longer continue to fight the country's military.”  
Abdul Saboor Qane, provincial governor, said that with the joining of these men in the peace process, ""security will improve in Zer-e-Koh and Shindand districts of the province.” 
“These men will be sent back to Zer-e-Koh in support of the security force members in fighting against the Taliban,” he said. 
The Taliban has not yet commented.
This comes as clashes are ongoing in some parts of the country, especially in the north of Afghanistan. 
Sources confirmed on Thursday that six district centers have fallen into Taliban control since last night: two districts (Qaramqul and Grezwan) in Faryab, Charcheno district in Uruzgan, Tala wa Barfak in Baghlan, Arza in Logar and Qarabagh district in Ghazni province. 
On April 14, US President Joe Biden announced that US troops will leave Afghanistan by September 11. Following the announcement, the Taliban attacks have escalated in the country. 
The UN envoy in Afghanistan Deborah Lyons in a briefing to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday night said the recent “intensive military campaign” by the Taliban will lead to continued violence in the country, and she reiterated that any attempt to install a government in Kabul by force will go against everyone’s interest.   
Lyons said the Taliban’s intensive military campaign “will lead to increased and prolonged violence that would extend the suffering of the Afghan people and threaten to destroy much of what has been built and hard-won in the last two decades.”   
She said that the Taliban’s recent advances are even more significant and are the result of an intensified military campaign. More than 50 of Afghanistan’s 370 districts have fallen since the beginning of May, she said.  
Most districts that have been taken are adjacent to provincial capitals, suggesting that the Taliban are positioning themselves to try and take these capitals once foreign forces are fully withdrawn, she noted.    
“This military campaign runs directly counter to recent statements by the head of the Taliban Political Commission that, and I quote, ‘We are committed to forging ahead with the other sides in an atmosphere of mutual respect (to) reach an agreement,’” she said.   
For the Taliban to continue this intensive military campaign would be a tragic course of action, Lyons said.

202,Badghis: Attack on Qala-e-Naw Again Pushed Back | TOLOnews,"Clashes between security forces and the Taliban began on Wednesday after the group attacked several parts of the city.   
Afghan security forces on Thursday again pushed back a Taliban attack on Qala-e-Naw, the capital of Badghis province in western Afghanistan.
Clashes between security forces and the Taliban began on Wednesday after the group attacked several parts of the city.   
Thursday morning the Taliban launched attacks close to the police HQ building, military base, and the National Directorate of Security (NDS) department in the city, the source said.  
""The forces again responded to the Taliban’s attack,” said Shir Aqa Alokozai, adding that “the situation in Qala-e-Naw is under the control of the security forces.” 
Military commander Hasibullah Akhundzada said: “In the morning there were heavy clashes between the security forces and the enemy in Qala-e-Naw but now there are none, and the Taliban has fled after suffering casualties in those areas where they attacked.” 
Earlier on Thursday,  Ziauddin Akazi, an MP from Badghis, said that the Taliban had resumed their attacks on the city, and he requested reinforcements from the government. He also raised concerns about the civilian situation in the city.  
At least two civilians were killed and more than 60 others were wounded in the fighting over the past two days, according to the health officials. 
Local officials said that several security officials had surrendered to the Taliban before the group launched attacks on the city. 
Khawja Murad Murad, a security official, Abubaker Muradi, deputy head of the National Directorate of Security (NDS), Sarajuddin Payman, a commander of a security outpost, Omar Azimi, security officer of PD1, Nadir, a commander of an outpost of the police public protection unit, Khir Mohammad Arefi, a commander of a territorial army, and dozens of other security forces members surrendered to the Taliban without any clash, according to the officials.  
Khan Jan Zafar and Mohammad Farid Akhizai, two members of the provincial council, also surrendered to the Taliban, officials said.
However, the Ministry of Defense on Thursday morning issued a statement saying that “a large number of Afghan commandos have arrived on Wednesday night in Qala-e-Naw and clearing operations are ongoing.”  
The ministry also said that “at least 69 Taliban were killed, and 23 others were wounded during Wednesday’s airstrike in several parts of Qala-e-Naw.”  
The Taliban has not commented on the attack on Qala-e-Naw.  
In the meantime, local officials in Herat province said that security forces retreated from Zenda Jan and Keshk-e-Kohna districts of the province last night.  
Some parts of Pashtoon Zarghoon, Kohsan and Shindand districts of Herat also fell to the Taliban since last night, according to officials.

146,Taliban Attacks Prove Group Has Not Changed: Ghani Aide | TOLOnews,"Following repeated attacks by the Taliban in various parts of the country, particularly in the north, President Ghani’s senior adviser Waheed Omer said on Tuesday that the group, with its attacks and “subversive” activities in the last month, has proved that it has not changed at all.  
Addressing a gathering to introduce Brig. Gen. Ajmal Omar Shinwari as spokesman for the security and defense forces, Omer said that recent attacks by the Taliban have caused hopes for peace in Afghanistan to vanish.
“Talib is the one who kills journalists, religious scholars. Talib is the one who goes everywhere and destroys bridges, schools and clinics,” Omer said. 
Moreover, hundreds of tribal elders and locals have taken up arms, forming various groups in Parwan, Kapisa, Baghlan, Kunduz, Takhar and Balkh provinces to fight alongside security forces on the frontlines against the Taliban. 
Some former mujahedeen leaders and residents of Jabal Siraj district in Parwan on Tuesday formed a social council of mujahedeen, warning that they will support the security forces on the frontlines if the Taliban violence continues. 
“Parwan should prepare 10,000 forces to defend Parwan and other neighboring provinces,” said Noor Habib Gulbahari, a former mujahedeen commander in Parwan. 
In Kapisa, a central province that neighbors Parwan and is north of Kabul, a group of former mujahedeen commanders mobilized residents to arm themselves and defend their areas. 
“The people are ready to go to the frontlines and fight international terrorism,” said Mohammad Husain Sanjani, the head of the Kapisa provincial council. 
In Baghlan province in northern Afghanistan, a large number of locals have mobilized to fight the Taliban. 
“Our personnel are on the frontlines. The personnel that you see here are the reserve forces,” said a public uprising forces commander in Baghlan. 
This is the first time that the public has shown a willingness to fight against the Taliban in such large numbers since the group increased its attacks. 
Ata Mohammad Noor, the head of the splinter faction of Jamiat-e-Islami Afghanistan, has pledged to mobilize the public in Balkh against the Taliban and to clear the province and restore stability.
“God forbid, the fall of Balkh means the fall of the north and the fall of the north means the fall of Afghanistan. We have experienced this. It is not a story, it is history,” Noor said. “We will not allow it to fall. We are here with a firm commitment to return security to the people and we will not leave them alone.” 
Some are against the mobilization of the public, saying it will increase the violence. 
“The mobilization of the people by politicians under the pretext of supporting security forces--with the use of public uprising forces--fuels the war from one side and from the other it affects Afghanistan’s stance in foreign policy,” said Habib-ur-Rahman Naqi, a member of the leadership council of Hizb-e-Islami. 
This comes as President Ghani met with influential political leaders on Monday to mobilize politicians to build a national consensus to manage the current situation.

283,Fighting Continues in Key Areas of Lashkargah for 2nd Day | TOLOnews,"Clashes continued in key parts of Lashkargah city in District 1 near the police headquarters and the provincial governor’s office on Sunday, causing concerns to ratchet up over the situation in the province.
Security sources said many parts of the city have fallen to the Taliban in recent weeks.
Helmand MPs said that the city will be out of the government’s control if it does not receive support. 
“The fighting has reached District 1 and is 100 meters or 200 meters away from the provincial governor’s compound. Fighting is underway to capture the base in the province and the people are concerned,” said Ghulam Wali Afghan, an MP from Helmand.
“Clashes are underway near the Helmand governor’s compound, the police headquarters and the NDS office. They will fall if attention is not paid to them,” said Karim Atal, an MP from Helmand.
But ANDSF spokesman Gen. Omar Shinwari said strong defensive lines have been established in Helmand, Herat and Kandahar and that there are no serious problems in the cities of these provinces.
TOLOnews findings show that 70 districts, as well as the Spin Boldak border town, fell to the Taliban in July. The government said that 11 districts had been retaken from the Taliban in July, but five of them--Yaftal in Badakhshan, Chakhansur in Nimroz, Malistan in Ghazni, Garmsir in Helmand and Guzara in Herat--have once again fallen to the Taliban.
“We will witness a worse situation if reforms are not brought to the leadership of military units,” said Mehrabuddin Safi, a military affairs analyst.
Insecurity has also affected Kabul. In a recent incident, unknown gunmen attacked a police vehicle in the Company area west of Kabul, killing a police officer and two civilians and wounding three more. 
“No one pays attention to security. We demand safety,” said Sayed Faqir, an eyewitness of the incident. 
“What is the sin of the ordinary people?” said Rafi, an eyewitness.
TOLOnews findings show that for just the month of July, 313 civilians and 239 security force members were wounded in security incidents and Taliban attacks. The figures show that 700 civilians and 216 security force members were wounded during this period.
The government said that the Taliban has sustained heavy casualties during this time.

236,‘967 Taliban Killed in 4 Days’ as Clashes Continue: ANDSF | TOLOnews,"The Afghan security and defense forces spokesman on Sunday said that 967 Talibs have been killed and over 500 more have been wounded in operations by Afghan forces in various areas over the last four days.
Gen. Ajmal Shinwari said that clashes are underway in over 20 provinces and nine cities face a high level of threat.
Afghan forces retook control of Sorkh-e-Parsa district in Parwan and Mailstan district in Ghazni in the last 12 hours, according to the Interior Ministry. But the center of Chakhansur district in Nimroz once again fell to the Taliban, according to sources.
“There is a possibility to improve the situation. We assure you--I say as a military general--that all Afghanistan territories will be defended with courage,” he said.
Heavy clashes have been reported on the outskirts of the city of Taluqan in the northeastern province of Takhar, raising concerns of residents who say the city has been under attack by the Taliban for the last two weeks.
“The situation is worsening every day. Shops have remained closed. Mortars and Taliban firing have hit people’s homes,” said Abdul Karim, a Taluqan resident.
“The government should make an effort to take the city out of this situation,” said Naqibullah, a Taluqan resident.
The head of Takhar provincial council, Wafiullah Rahmani, said the people have supported the government forces in their campaign to prevent the fall of the city to the Taliban.
“Takhar residents are dignified people. They will defend their territory. As you see, I am the people’s representative and want to be with this people,” Rahmani said.
In Kunduz city in the north, residents said the situation is dire and they fear attacks by the Taliban.
“My home is in the Number One area in Kunduz city. I was displaced. My home was hit by a mortar. Two members of our family were martyred and four more were wounded,” said Farzana, a Kunduz resident, who was injured in the incident.
“Besides concerns about the insecurity on the outskirts of Kunduz city, another deep concern is about Taliban drones that drop bombs in some areas. We ask international organizations and the Afghan Air Force to clear Kunduz air of this parasite,” said Rabbani Rabbani, member of the Kunduz provincial council.
Local sources report heavy fighting between government forces and the Taliban in Nijrab district in Kapisa, almost 100 kilometers north of Kabul.

177,"'6,000 Taliban Killed in Past Month': Govt | TOLOnews","As intense fighting continues in the country, Afghan authorities on Tuesday said that over 6,000 Taliban fighters, including Pakistani nationals, have been killed in fighting with the Afghan National Security and Defense Forces (ANDSF) over the past one month.
Ajmal Omar Shinwari, a spokesman for Afghan forces, on Tuesday said that another 3,400 Taliban fighters were wounded during this period. He said that the Afghan Chief of Army Staff is currently working on a plan that the government forces will use to recapture the territory lost to the Taliban.
Meanwhile, the commander of the Special Operations Corps said the unit's activity has increased by 30 percent following the official start of the withdrawal of foreign forces from the country two months ago.
According to the Afghan government, over the past one month, 6,033 Taliban fighters were killed--among them 33 Pakistani nationals--and 3,485 Taliban fighters were wounded--among them 9 Pakistani nationals.
The Afghan government said the role of the Afghan Air Force (AAF) has been crucial in inflicting a major human toll on the Taliban during this period.
The Taliban, however, has rejected the claims by the Afghan government.
“Our entire force is staying in an emergency position, particularly the commandos and special operation forces,” said Ajmal Omar Shinwari, a spokesman for the ANDSF.
“In the planning and technical fields we confronted some challenges,” added Shinwari.
Afghan security officials said that during the past one month, the ANDSF air force carried out 491 attacks on Taliban positions.
“The Afghan Air Force conducted 491 airstrikes in the past one month, in which they targeted Taliban gatherings in Faryab, Baghlan, Helmand, Maidan Wardak, Nangarhar and Laghman provinces,” said Rohullah Ahmadzai, a spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense.
The Afghan Air Force currently has 160 aircraft, 20 of which are Russian-made.
50 are Black Hawk helicopters, four are C130s, and 26 are Mi-17 helicopters.
“In the past, the need for airstrikes was around 20 to 30 percent, but in the past two months the percentage has increased to 70 to 80 percent,” said Abdul Fatah Eshaqzai, a commander of the Afghan Air Force.
The Afghan government has said that the US has pledged the delivery of another 45 helicopters and 7 e-29 helicopters to the Afghan army.
Currently, 25 helicopters are abroad for repair.

Security personnel in Lashkargah city, the capital of Helmand, were relocated to the Afghan Army’s 205 Atal Corps in Shorabak near the city following an agreement with the Taliban, officials said.  
Similar relocation was reported in Kandahar city. All security personnel were relocated to the 215 Maiwand Corps. 
Lawmakers from the three provinces did not comment on the dramatic fall of the three capital cities in the span of almost 12 hours.  
Kandahar residents said Taliban captured all government facilities including the police headquarters, office of the National Directorate of Security (NDS) and the governor’s office without facing any resistance by security forces. 
“Last night, Taliban overran all parts of the city,” said Mohammad Yar Majroh, a journalist in Kandahar. 
“There has been a major catastrophe in Lashkargah. Civilian homes were bombed. Casualties occurred among civilians,” said Majid Akhundzada, member of Helmand provincial council.

The districts are Maimai, Nusai, Shuki, Khwahan, Ishakashim, Shuhada and Yawan in Badakhshan, Nish and Mianshin in Kandahar, Nawa in Helmand and Shinwari in Parwan.
Badakhshan residents in northeastern Afghanistan said the security situation in the province is alarming, following the fall of 24 districts around the country to the Taliban in the last few days. 
“Weak management led to the collapse of the districts,” said Muhayyuddin Munsif, a senator. “The situation will worsen if they don’t review their plans.” 
“No district is under government control in Takhar after Worsaj collapsed. Only the city of Taluqan is under government control,” said Hamiduddin Yuldish, an MP from Takhar. 
Tajik media reported that at least 1,000 Afghan security force members have sought safety across the border in Tajikistan through the bordering areas of Badakhshan. 
“Only the Kiran wa Monjan district and the center of the district are left. Kiran Munjan will also be evacuated in the direction of Panjshir. Only Faizabad has been left. Based on our information, the Taliban has evacuated the outskirts of Faizabad – it could be for any reason,” said Zabihullah Atiq, an MP from Badakhshan. 
“A large number of special forces and the commandos have arrived in Badakhshan and we will soon start operations to retake the lost areas,” said Gen. Abbas Tawakuli, the commander of 207 Pamir Corps.

The New York Times on Sunday wrote that US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin in a meeting with the current commander of US and NATO forces Gen. Austin Miller, Joint Chiefs Chaiman Gen. Mark A. Milley and Centcom head Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. discussed Afghanistan and specifically ways to buffer the impact of the US pullout on the Afghan people. 
On Friday, the US military left Bagram Airbase in Parwan province, north of Kabul, effectively ending US operations, although a contingent of US military personnel have been left behind to guard the US embassy.
Austin ordered a series of steps to slow the pace of the final withdrawal from America’s longest war, said The New York Times.

142,Fighting Reaches Outskirts of Major Cities in North | TOLOnews,"Fighting has reached five cities in the north as many districts around provincial capitals have fallen to the Taliban in the last few weeks, mostly in Faryab and Takhar provinces. 
Lawmakers and residents warned that fighting around the cities of Maimana in Faryab, Taluqan in Takhar, Pul-e-Khumri in Baghlan, Sar-e-Pul city in Sar-e-Pul and Kunduz city in Kunduz province have raised concerns among the people.  
The main route that connects Kabul with northern provinces has been closed to traffic for the last two days because of Taliban influence in Doshi district in Baghlan. 
The government announced that security forces had retaken two districts in Takhar; however, many districts across the country that are in Taliban control are being reported: Sources said that security forces left the three districts of Sholgara, Dawlat Abad and Kushinda in Balkh; the Qala-e-Zal and Imam Sahib district in Kunduz; Doshi and Julga districts in Baghlan; Aqcha district in Jawzjan; and Zazai Aryub district in the eastern province of Paktia in the last 24 hours. 
“There isn’t anyone to help. The fighting has reached the entrance to Pul-e-Khumri,” said Ajmal, a resident of Pul-e-Khumri. 
“How long will this bloodshed continue?” said Enayat, a Pul-e-Khumri resident. 
A woman, a resident of Balkh, who was on the way to Kabul said she lost her husband who was caught in a crossfire. 
“Suddenly there were clashes. We asked the driver to stop. He didn’t. Glass fell on the people. I lost my father,” said Sahar, a Balkh resident. 
Activists from Faryab who have come to Kabul said that the city of Maimana, the capital of Faryab, is on the verge of collapse and that there is a need for urgent action by the government. 
“Last night, Faryab residents had no place to spend the night. They were displaced. I don’t know why the government does not pay attention to this?” said Frozan Khalilyar, an activist from Faryab. 
Pul-e-Khumri and Taluqan residents meanwhile said security forces are in dire need of reinforcements. 
The fighting has also gripped the northern provinces of Sar-e-Pul and Kunduz. Kunduz temporarily fell to the Taliban back in 2015 and 2016. 
“The situation in Kunduz is deeply concerning. The government officials have no plan to address it,” said Amruddin Wali, a member of the provincial council in Kunduz. 
But the Defense Ministry said that thorough plans are underway to suppress the Taliban. 
“They are fighting the enemy with full force and the security and defense institutions--from the leadership to the soldiers on the battlefield--are making efforts to bring positive changes in those areas,’’ said Rohullah Ahmadzai, a spokesman for the ministry.

“This is the 10th district that collapses one after another. The local government and the central government have forgotten them and are not paying attention to them,” said Saed Hayatullah, a resident of Faizabad.  
Amidst concerning situation in Faizabad, the police chief of Badakhshan, Khalil-ur-Rahman Jawad is under treatment in Kabul as he has tested positive for COVID-19.   
“What we should do is to mobilize the elders of the ‘resistance region’ and create history for the second time by the second generation of the resistance,” said Nilofar Ibrahimi, an MP from Badakhshan.  
“They are faced with lack of logistics. The Air Force cannot address all areas. This is concerning,” said Sayed Muqaddam Amin, a former military officer.  
Meanwhile, sources from Takhar said that with the fall of Kalafgan and Farkhar districts, only Taluqan city and Worsaj districts have remained under government control in the province.  
“We have 16 administrative units. All collapsed one after another. The security situation in Taluqan is sensitive,” said Abdul Kabir, a resident of Taluqan.

303,White House ‘Concerned’ about Continued Taliban Violence | TOLOnews,"Recent actions by the Taliban will not help them gain international legitimacy, the White House said on Friday, after the group killed the Afghan government’s senior media officer in Kabul.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at the White House said the administration is “closely tracking” and is “concerned about” retaliatory killings of civilians.
“If the Taliban claim to want international legitimacy, these actions are not going to get them the legitimacy they seek. They do not have to stay on this trajectory. They could choose to devote the same energy to the peace process as they are to their military campaign,” Psaki said.
Taliban captured the city of Zaranj, the capital of Nimroz province in southwestern Afghanistan, on Friday. They also claimed responsibility for killing Dawa Khan Menapal, the head of the Afghan government’s media and information center.
“First, let me strongly condemn, on behalf of the government, of course, the assassination of Dawa Khan Menapal, the director of the Afghan governmental information media center. His murder follows the bombing attack in Kabul earlier this week, the targeting at the acting Afghan defense minister,” Psaki said. “The Taliban has claimed responsibility for this later attack, and there’s no reason to doubt reports they are responsible.”
At least eight people were killed and 20 were wounded in the Taliban’s failed assassination attempt of Acting Defense Minister Gen. Bismillah Mohammadi last week on Tuesday.

320,Taliban Control Most of Farah City: Reports | TOLOnews,"Reports say that the Taliban have taken over most areas of Farah city following fierce battles with the Afghan security forces.
Sources said that heavy fighting is currently underway in the centers of Badakhshan, Baghlan and Faryab provinces.
Afghan security agencies are not providing information about developments on the frontlines in the north.
“The Taliban launched four attacks on the Farah police headquarters, but we defeated them,” said an Afghan soldier in Farah, Zabihullah Atal.
Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reported that it has treated 4,042 weapon-wounded patients at 15 health facilities since the start of August.
Hundreds of thousands of civilians are at risk as fighting intensifies in and around Kunduz, Lashkar Gah, Kandahar, and other Afghan cities. 
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has called on both warring sides to show restraint and protect civilians and vital infrastructure such as hospitals from attacks, especially in urban areas.
“We are seeing homes destroyed, medical staff and patients put at tremendous risk, and hospitals, electricity and water infrastructure damaged,” said Eloi Fillion, ICRC’s head of delegation in Afghanistan. “The use of explosive weaponry in cities is having severe and indiscriminate effects on the civilian population well beyond its target. Many families have no option but to flee in search of a safer place. This must stop.”
“The situation is very concerning, the city is under the siege, I don’t know what the government is planning to defend the city,” said Bahadur, a resident in Badakhshan.
“The people have a lot of apprehensions about this issue,” said Wahid Shayoun, a resident in Badakhshan.
Fighting is also reported in Pul-e-Khumri, the capital of Baghlan.
“They launched about 100 attacks around Pul-e-Khumri city, but all attacks were repelled,” said Baghlan governor Akbar Barakzai.
In Kapisa province, there are reports that the Taliban have recaptured Nejrab district.
“We call on the government to pay attention to Kapisa and support security forces and public uprising forces,” said a resident in Kapisa, Kaka Mohammad.
“All people should mobilize behind their defense and security forces, they can prevent the advance of the enemies together,” said military analyst Safiullah Safi.
However, sources have said that there has been no plan so far for the recapture of Zaranj, Sheberghan, Kunduz, Sar-e-Pul, Taluqan and Aibak cities, but the security institutions have not given information about the security developments in the north.
The ICRC says that electricity is out across several contested cities and water supply systems are barely operational in some places. “Many families are trying to leave but cannot find transport to escape or simply do not have the financial means,” the ICRC said.
The ICRC and its partner the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) say they are operating at full capacity to evacuate the wounded and transport the remains of those killed as a result of the conflict. In July alone, the ICRC helped nearly 13,000 patients suffering from weapon-related injuries across the country, and this number appears likely to rise this month as fighting increases in highly populated areas.
“Health-care facilities, medical workers, and ambulances must be spared at all cost,” said Fillion. “We also call on all fighting parties to allow humanitarian organizations like the ICRC and ARCS to safely evacuate the injured and bring much-needed assistance to the civilian population.”

309,Analysts Predict Decrease in Govt Revenue as Border Town Falls | TOLOnews,"Analysts predict that the fall of Zaranj city on the border with Iran will deprive the Afghan government from $175 million in revenue a year.
With the fall of Zaranj, the Taliban is now controlling at least 10 border towns, including Islam Qala and Torghundi in Herat, Abu Nasr-e-Farahi in Farah, Spin Boldak in Kandahar, Sher Khan in Kunudz, Dand-e-Pathan in Paktia, Ai Khanum in Takhar and Ishkashim crossing point in the northeastern province of Badakhshan.
“Main reasons are linked to government's failures, incompetency and corruption. They handed over a province like a district,” said Baz Mohammad Naser, head of Nimroz provincial council.
“Here, the people are screaming, but the border is closed,” said Mohammad Asfar, a resident of Nimroz.
The Afghan government is now controlling few border towns, including Aqian in Faryab, Hairatan in Balkh, Angor Ada in Paktika, Ghulam Khan in Khost and Torkham crossing in the eastern province of Nangarhar.
The fall of Zaranj has also raised deep concerns over a surge in the smuggling of fuel to Afghanistan.
Nimroz besides enjoying bordres with Iran and Pakistan is also the monitoring point of the Helmand river from where the water flows to Afghanistan’s newly built Kamal Khan and Salma dams in Herat.
“Other ports that we had in the west are now out of the government control. I think this will create a major problem for the central government,” said MP Farishta Amini.
“The Afghan businessmen are facing the great loss due to the current situation in Nimroz,” said Massoud Forogh, former head of fuel department in the north zone.
The Taliban’s control in Spin Boldak has left hundreds of convoys and passengers stranded along the Durand Line.
On Friday, the Taliban closed Spin Boldak crossing for a while, saying the Pakistani government is implementing a transportation mechanism that it has signed with the Afghan government, not with them.
Zaranj is the first provincial capital that has fallen to the Taliban. The Taliban also took the control of Sheberghan city on Saturday.

Taliban attacked the provincial capital on Thursday night. Their attacks were followed by hundreds of residents of the city, flocking towards the border with Iran, in a desperate search for safety.
There are also reports that government assets were looted in different parts of the city.
Reports say that the Taliban after capturing Kanak district in Nimroz brutally executed at least 30 soldiers. But the Taliban have rejected the allegations, saying the soldiers were killed during clashes.
“All people including women and children had flocked there,” said a resident in Nimroz, referring to an attempt by hundreds of Nimroz residents to cross the border to Iran.
A video from Nimroz shows that several bodies purportedly of the government forces lying on the ground. The Taliban reportedly tortured the soldiers, maimed them and took out their eyes before killing them.
“Based on the international law, it is counted as a war crime, it is also against Islamic principles,” said Laal Gul Laal, the head of human rights organization.
“The rejection of all these killings on the battlefields doesn’t acquit them (Taliban) from responsibility,” said Zabihullah Farhang, a spokesman for Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission.
Nimroz has five districts of which three are completely under the control of the Taliban.

Many videos were released following the fall of Zaranj to the Taliban showing people carrying equipment as they took them out of government institutions, including governor’s compound.
Another footage from Zaranj shows prisoners escaping the main provincial prison. A similar scenario happened in Sheberghan, the capital of Jawzjan in northern Afghanistan, after it fell to the Taliban on Saturday.
“This shows the Taliban has no plan for governance or for providing service to the people,” presidential adviser Shahussain Murtazawi said. “This time, Talibs are following the policy of looting.”
“I have already mentioned that if the Taliban had the will to build, they should first come up with peace, sit with Afghans and build this country together,” Zabul provincial council’s chairman Ata Jan Haq Bayan said.
Religious scholars also condemned indifference to protection of public property by the people.
“Wasting public property is forbidden. Anyone who takes over public property, must protect it and must prevent its waste,” said Mawlawi Abdul Wadood, a religious scholar.
Ordinary Afghans asked the warring parties to protect public property in areas under their control.
“Looting public property is a war crime. It is inhuman,” said Kamran, a Kabul resident.
“Public property such as government buildings and bridges should be protected,” said Rashid Farhang, a Takhar resident.
As violence continues in the country, the government said last month that in the districts recently seized by the Taliban, essential government services have been halted, and a large number of civil servants have been harmed, or displaced from their areas to provincial capitals.
According to government findings, the Taliban either torched or destroyed 260 government buildings and assets in 116 districts.
The findings show that 13 million Afghans have been deprived of social services in the Taliban-held areas and 50,000 employees, including women, have been affected in areas under the influence of the group.
Taliban has rejected the findings. The group announced on Saturday that all government employees “will be safe” in areas under their control.

Mohib said that al Qaeda is playing a key role in keeping the Taliban’s war machine active in Afghanistan. 
Taliban has often rejected the allegations that it still maintains close ties with al Qaeda.
“The Taliban claims that no other group can conduct the (war), except them, the Taliban also claim that when they give order, the violence stops and no one is there to launch attack. In this scenario, all responsibilities go to the Taliban,"" he said. ""But there are also other groups that conduct such activities. You saw the statement of Al Qaeda. Daesh is also operating there, but all these are carrying out their activities in harmony with the Taliban.""

19,Taliban ‘In Principle’ Has no Problem With Istanbul Summit: HCNR | TOLOnews,"The High Council of National Reconciliation (HCNR) on Thursday said that the US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad told the Afghan government that the Taliban in principle have no problem with participating in the upcoming UN-led conference on Afghanistan in Turkey.
Assadullah Saadati, the deputy head of the HCNR, said that the Taliban want to convene a preliminary meeting before heading to Turkey; but the Taliban have so far not made any official comment about it.
Meanwhile, the Taliban, in a weekly statement, called on the UN and the US to remove the names of Taliban leaders from the blacklist if they want the peace process to reach a conclusion.
“The argument is that in principle they do not see any problem with the Istanbul conference, however, they suggested a preliminary meeting to be held before to help the Istanbul conference be result-oriented,” said Assadullah Saadati, the deputy head of the HCNR.
Continued Taliban violence in the country, however, is causing widespread concern among Afghans.
“The people are feeling a lot of pain, they have a lot of worries because of the wars, because only the innocent people are the victims,” said Zabihullah Mojadadadi, the head of Jabha-e-Milli Nejat party.
“The strangers make the decision on war and peace, let's come together and take the initiative on our own,” said Gul Rahman Qazi, the head of Shurai-e-Sulh Wa Nejat party.
“We see the government day and night say that we are ready for fighting and chant the slogan of war, lets chant the slogan of peace,” said Sayed Akbar Agha, a former Taliban commander.
“The foreign troops' withdrawal should be conducted in a manner so that Afghanistan does not engage in a civil war after their withdrawal,” said Fazel Hadi Wazin, a member of Hizb-e-Islami.
The Turkey conference on Afghanistan is expected in the next few weeks.

29,Survivors of School Attack Recall Ordeal | TOLOnews,"Out of 150 people wounded in the Kabul school bombing, at least 50 were taken to the state-owned Ali Jinnah Hospital in Kabul, where one of the teenagers who was critically wounded succumbed to her injuries on Sunday morning.
The wounded who underwent surgery remembered the ordeal, during which they lost their closest classmates and friends.
Those injured in the deadly bombing were taken for treatment to at least 12 hospitals in Kabul.
Hamida, a teenage student, said her right hand has been broken in the explosion. Her father is a day laborer. She said she did not have the money to buy medicine and other required equipment for the surgery of her broken hand.
“I hope she gets well soon,” said Mohammad Akbar, Hamida’s father.
Hamida’s parents said they lost all hope for their daughter following the explosion as they searched for her for hours.
Hamida said she is traumatized and she loses consciousness when she remembers the deadly attack and seeing the remains and belongings of her classmates that surrounded her following the first blast.
“I remember very bad things… Like the burned bodies,” Hamida said, while shedding tears.
Zahra, 15, who succumbed to her injuries, was in the 10th grade at the school. Her mother said they have four children, and all were enrolled in government schools as they could not afford the tuition at private schools.
“Their clothes were burned. They were stained with dust,” Zahra’s mother, Masooma, said.
Zainab, 13, was wounded when she was buying a pen from a shop in front of the school when the blast happened. Although she was injured, she started the search for her elder sister after the explosion, she said.
Zainab’s father, Mohammad Arif, said that he would have sent his children to better schools if he had the financial ability.
“I work one day, and I can find no work for three more days… I earn up to 7,000 Afs each month,” Arif said.
Of the 50 wounded who were taken to Ali Jinah Hospital, five were in the emergency ward on Sunday.
“There were some martyrs whose identities were not known. The family of one of them was found this morning -- many of them were burned,” said Jawed Akbar, a chief physician at the hospital.
According to sources, 107 of the wounded are girls and 33 are boys.

“The United States legitimized them. The Doha office is a creation of the United States. Getting Mullah Baradar out of the jail is an invention of the United States. Allowing them to travel here and there is with the help of the United States. Of course, Doha agreement is between the United States and the Taliban. They should be held accountable,” Saleh said. 
“At the end of the day, United States is a superpower, unless it says I'm not. It's a superpower, and they have leverage--all over. We respect that leverage because, as a needy country, we need the United States to remain engaged-- engaged diplomatically, economically, strategically. You know, as I said, what you see as a change in Afghanistan is largely, largely due to investment of the United States here,” he said. 
On the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, Saleh told CBS: “They have taken a decision, and we respect that decision. I'm sure they have calculated the risks. But if you ask me to remind them what is the risk, Taliban are terrorists.” 
The US military planners are looking for options to base forces and equipment in Central Asia and the Middle East after American and allied troops leave Afghanistan in the coming months, The Wall Street Journal reported.  
The report said that the US military commanders want bases for troops, drones, bombers and artillery to shore up the Afghan government, keep the Taliban insurgency in check and monitor other extremists. 
Options being assessed range from nearby countries to more distant Arab Gulf emirates and navy ships at sea, US government and military officials told The Wall Street Journal. 
According to some military and Biden administration officials, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan would be preferable, because they border Afghanistan and would allow for quick access. But Russia and China's influence in the area and tensions between them and Washington complicate plans for Central Asian bases, the officials said. 
“The drive to work looks like it will be a little bit longer for now,” one official said. 
Last month, US President Joe Biden announced that American troops will leave Afghanistan by September 11. NATO will also exit troops from the country by the same deadline.

35,UK Military Chief: No Reason for Taliban’s Jihad in Afghanistan | TOLOnews,"General Sir Nicholas Carter, Chief of General Staff of the United Kingdom, has said that the Taliban has no justification for their Jihad in Afghanistan now that foreign forces are leaving the country.
In an interview with TOLOnews, General Carter said that the Taliban are now fighting against the Afghan people, and they should avoid the war.
Meanwhile, the Afghan Presidential Palace has said that President Ashraf Ghani in a joint meeting with Gen. Carter and the Pakistani Army Chief Gen. Qamar Jawed Bajwa discussed bilateral relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Afghan peace process and ways to end the violence in the country.
“There is no reason for the Taliban ever to be talking about Jihad again, they are now waging war against the Afghans,” said General Carter, Chief of General Staff of the United Kingdom.
Asked if Pakistan is harboring the Taliban, Gen. Carter said: “The plain fact is Pakistan recognizes that it has the similar problem to Afghanistan in terms of terrorism. Indeed, General Bajwa often described it as a disease, and ultimately, that disease will really only be solved by Afghanistan and Pakistan working closely together to get after that disease.""
He added: ""I am pretty confident that they both understand the problem in the same way and they will get after the problem collectively as partners.”
Ambassador Alison Blake, the UK's envoy to Afghanistan, meanwhile said that the UK will continue its political engagement with Afghanistan and will cooperate with the Afghan National Security and Defense Forces (ANDSF).
“Security in the country is something where we very much support the ANDSF in the government, the responsibility to keep citizens safe in Afghanistan is with the government, so, but we give the assurances that we can and that’s why it's good that General Carter is here [to show] our support of the UK to the republic of Afghanistan, to our partners in the ANDSF and to the people of Afghanistan--whether that is through development, to the economic aid, humanitarian assistance or our political engagement and lobbying will continue,” said UK ambassador to Afghanistan Alison Blake.
Meanwhile, a number of political commentators have said the recent meetings between Pakistani and British military officials show that London is trying to facilitate a new security agreement between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
It is said that General Nicholas Carter has a long acquaintance with President Ashraf Ghani and his Pakistani counterpart General Bajwa.
General Nicholas Carter has also served in Afghanistan for several years while Ghani was serving as head of the security transition commission from foreign forces to the Afghan forces.
General Carter has so far facilitated several mediatory meetings between high level officials from Afghanistan and Pakistan.
US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad on Monday welcomed the announcements by the Afghan government and the Taliban to observe an Eid ceasefire, and said “violence has been horrific in recent weeks, and the Afghan people have paid the price,” reiterating that the United States stands with the people of Afghanistan.
Khalilzad said that Afghans need “a political settlement and a permanent ceasefire.""
He called for accelerated negotiations among Afghans on a political settlement and ""an end to this senseless war.
""This is what the Afghan people yearn for,"" he added.
Khalilzad also in an interview with Der Spiegel published on Monday has said that the Afghan people are longing for peace and that there has to be peace and there is no better alternative.
“The Taliban spoke to the US and the European group in Berlin this week by video. They said they don't see a military solution and say that the only option is a political one. Both sides have to be realistic about finding common ground. If there is no peace agreement, the alternative is not a Taliban victory. It is a long war,” he said in the interview.

39,Taliban Should Take Opportunity for Peace: Ghani | TOLOnews,"President Ashraf Ghani on Thursday, after Eid prayers at the Presidential Place, called on the Taliban to use the opportunity for peace created by the foreign troops leaving the country. 
The prayer ceremony was attended by former president Hamid Karzai, Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, the Parliament speaker Mir Rahman Rahmani, Senate speaker Fazl Hadi Muslimyar and a number of other politicians and government officials.
“The Taliban cannot have a better chance than this as the international troops are leaving the country,” Ghani said, adding that “the people's arms are open to them” and end the war.  
“Our people know who is responsible for blasts and suicide attacks,” Ghani said. “We don’t want destruction, we want development.”  
“The international troops' withdrawal from Afghanistan is a great opportunity,” he said. “The new chapter of our cooperation with the international community has started.” 
“Today, the region looks at Afghanistan as an opportunity,” he said. 
“There is political consensus in the country, and the Republic is an umbrella for all,” Ghani said.  
“Let's see the Taliban's intention,” he said, referring to the peace efforts. “All the politicians want an Afghan-owned and Afghan-led peace process.”  
“What is your (Taliban) message, what do you want, why are you destroying the districts?” Ghani said. Show us one district where you have complete control and have built something.”  
He mentioned that the Taliban’s war has costed the nation $1billion.

“Soon you will witness a regional consensus on the Afghan peace process,"" he said, adding that regional support for Afghanistan is increasing. 
""Afghanistan’s peace and stability means peace and stability in the region,” he said.

President Ghani warned of a third wave of COVID-19 and called on the people to follow the health guidance of the Ministry of Public Health during Eid days.

“We are Muslims. We should not fight against each other. If we want to fight, we should fight united against those countries that have an eye on our soil,” Dostum said.
In Balkh province, meanwhile, Atta Mohammad Noor, the head of the splinter faction of the Jamiat-e-Islami party, in an address to the residents of the northern province made a similar statement to the Taliban and warned the group that “it would be suppressed” if the opportunity for peace was lost.
“If a real mobilization was made, I am saying here among thousands of people that I promise to take over 50% of areas controlled by Taliban in a blink if there is war-- but I pray that there is no more war,” Noor said.
But another former mujahedeen leader, Juma Khan Hamdard, who is head of the council of the Hizb-e-Islami party, said differences among the country’s political leaders and the “monopolization” of peace affairs by the Presidential Palace have prolonged the stalled peace negotiations with the Taliban.
“The peace negotiations have stalled for the last six months. It is delayed from one day to another day. We have many plans (for peace). We would have achieved peace in two months if we came together around the government and if we had a unified plan,” Hamdard said.
This comes as the US and coalition forces have begun withdrawing from Afghanistan and a much-expected conference on Afghanistan in Turkey has been delayed multiple times over non-participation by the Taliban. Meanwhile, violence has also remained high in the country, especially during Ramadan – April 13 to May 13 – during which the Ministry of Interior Affairs said that more than 250 civilians were killed in Taliban violence across the country.

42,US to Tackle Terrorism Threats in Afghanistan after Withdrawal | TOLOnews,"The Pentagon has said that the United States will address the issue of threats emancipating from terrorism in Afghanistan even after the withdrawal of American forces from the country.
David Helvey, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs, told members of US Congress Committee on Armed Services that the United States was assessing ways to combat terrorist groups in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of the US and coalition forces.
“As part of the inter-agency review of the United States’ policy in Afghanistan, the administration assesses that threat from violent extremist organizations against the United States now emanating from Afghanistan can be addressed without a persistent United States’ military presence in that country,” Helvey said.
“At the same time, we work closely with the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces and with our allies and partners to maintain counterterrorism capabilities in the region sufficient to ensure that Afghanistan cannot again become a safe haven for terrorists,” he added.
But a member of the US House of Representatives said that the Taliban will fight until they take the power by force.
“Since May 1st, Taliban has been crystal clear about their intentions. They have launched a new offensive targeting coalition forces, Afghan soldiers and innocent civilians. On Saturday, the Taliban bombed a girls school in Kabul, killing over 50 people, most of them young girls. Make no mistake, they will fight until they control that country again,” said Mike Rogers, a member of the US House of Representatives.  
Meanwhile, The New York Times has reported that western spy agencies are evaluating and courting regional leaders outside the Afghan government who might be able to provide intelligence about terrorist threats long after US forces withdraw, according to current and former American, European and Afghan officials.
Ahmad Massoud, the son of Afghanistan’s National Hero Ahmad Shah Massoud, is one of the names in the report among new allies for US in the country after the troops withdrawal.
“Among the candidates being considered today for intelligence gathering is the son of Ahmad Shah Massoud, the famed Afghan fighter who led fighters against the Soviets in the 1980s and then against the Taliban as head of the Northern Alliance the following decade. The son — Ahmad Massoud, 32 — has spent the last few years trying to revive the work of his father by assembling a coalition of militias to defend Afghanistan’s north,” wrote the report.
Based on the report, top CIA officials, including William J. Burns, the agency’s director, have acknowledged that they are looking for new ways to collect information in Afghanistan once American forces are withdrawn, and their ability to gather information on terrorist activity is diminished.
Washington is more divided, and some government analysts do not think Massoud would be able to build an effective coalition.
But in the New York Times report it was writthen whether the new allies were aimed to fight the Taliban in the future.

The sources said that the group plans to attend the Istanbul summit, but wants the end negotiations to take place in Doha. 
The negotiating teams met in Doha on May 14 after a long pause. Sources familiar with the meeting said the Taliban has asked to maintain the Doha negotiations--with serious discussions-- but they want the final outcome to be achieved in Doha, not in Istanbul. 
“I think that this will open the way for an Istanbul conference where the Taliban will attend. They might make the agenda based on who in the Afghan government team will attend, not based on the US agenda,” said Sayed Akbar Agha, a former Taliban commander. 
The Republic team said that efforts in Doha and Istanbul will help achieve results in the negotiations, but they stressed that the Taliban’s commitment is key. 
“A meeting will be meaningful when the attendees include decision-makers and when there is a commitment for decision making. Only participation of high-ranking leaders can affect the current Doha process,” said Fawzia Koofi, member of the negotiating team of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.

“We’re watching closely what the Taliban will do post the Eid ceasefire,” Miller said in an interview with the BBC. “Ideally, they would continue with the reduced violence because it is something that the Afghan people want. But the expectation is that they will pick up violence in the nearer term.” 
“I do expect that we’ve seen Taliban surge pressure on different provincial capitals,” he said as quoted by BBC. 
In response to a question about whether the US has failed in its mission in Afghanistan, he said: “Certainly, there were some victories along the way, but I think history will judge this and the future will tell the rest of the story.” 
Sources close to the Taliban said that there has been progress in the release of 7,000 prisoners of the group by the Afghan government. The sources said that the Taliban is expected to hold a session with the US about the withdrawal of American forces from the country. 
“Big hopes exist that the Taliban prisoners will be released and that the foreigners and the Taliban will achieve a new agreement on the withdrawal of American forces (from Afghanistan),” said Sayed Akbar Agha, a former Taliban commander. 
The Afghan government said that the release of prisoners will depend on agreements within the peace negotiations.

“The threat of terrorism has changed. It has not disappeared. We are all agreed on this,” Ghani said in an interview with PBS on May 17. “The United States is committed to support things, providing support. This is financial, in the security area, in the economic area, in the humanitarian area, because the United States, fortunately, shares the values of supporting the gains of the last 20 years. And our discussion is enormously productive. The same, fortunately, applies to NATO members and non-NATO members who have been our partners.” 
President Ghani has recently held talks with influential political leaders, namely the reconciliation council chief Abdullah Abdullah, former president Hamid Karzai, former mujahedeen leader Abdul Rab Rasul Sayyaf, and others to build a consensus around peace and form a high-level state council.  
Sources familiar with the meetings said that the list of the members of the council will be finalized by the end of this week.  
Moreover, the Taliban has shown signs of willingness to resume the peace negotiations in Doha. But in Afghanistan violence remains increasingly high despite a three-day ceasefire from May 12 to May 15.
The Defense Ministry reported clashes in 18 provinces just two days after the end of the ceasefire. 
President Ghani once again reiterated that that “the key to a political dialogue is that the Taliban accept that the future political system of Afghanistan is based on elections.” 
“That is the fundamental bottom line. Other things are discussible, negotiable. But if that fundamental issue is not granted, then the question of rights and the question of gains that have occurred in the last 20 years, particularly vis-a-vis women, youth, minorities, all walks of life, will be put into question,” Ghani said as quoted by PBS.

School officials say the students need treatment because so far they have not been able to forget the devastating incident that killed their classmates. 
The principal of the school said that at least 90 students were killed and nearly 250 more were wounded in the attack. Some figures show that at least 30 students were killed and wounded from just one class. 
“What haunts me are the voices of the wounded and the parents who were desperately shouting and searching for their children,” said Samira, a student at the school. 
“I will continue my classes no matter what happens while I am alive. This country will be prosperous one day,” said Sabera, a student at the school.  
“When electricity is out, I fear a lot. I was so close; therefore, I was terrified by its sound. I get scared when I hear loud sounds,” said Nazanin Danesh, a student at the school. 
Fatima, a student in the 11th grade, opened her mouth to speak after 10 days, but what she says is mostly about the bitter stories of the triple blasts near their school that killed her classmates and friends. 
“When I remember, I lose hope. This much hope I had, this much effort I made, all vanished at one moment,” Fatima said. 
A psychologist who visits the school every day said two days back that over 100 students were in critical condition psychologically. These students were taken for treatment, the psychologist Zahra Husaini said.  
“In order to help them recover, we try to help them acknowledge the reality of what they experienced,” Husaini said. 
One class where at least 40 students were studying normally has had only two students attending over the last 11 days. Buckets of flowers have been put on all desks where students once sat. One of the two students who attended the class on Tuesday was wounded in the attack but survived. There is no news on the more than 30 remaining students in that specific class, said TOLOnews reporter Zahra Rahimi, who visited the class. 
“The martyrs' families said that the government should ensure security and then they we will send their children to school. They said that they do not want their remaining children to be targeted by such an incident,” said Aqila Tawakuli, the principal of the school. 
The latest figures from school officials show that all 90 students who were killed in the blasts were aged between 13 and 18 years old.

58,"In 5th Day of Protests, Access Blocked to Faryab Education Office | TOLOnews","Wednesday marked the fifth day of protests against the appointment of a new governor for Faryab, and demonstrators blocked access to the Faryab education department.
The protestors railed against the appointment of Mohammad Daud Laghmani as the new governor.
On Tuesday protestors blocked the doors of at least five government offices in the province, including the provincial municipality office, the department of women’s affairs, the department of labor and the department of public works.
This comes two days after Daud Laghmani was appointed as the new governor of Faryab at an Afghan Army facility in Faryab.
Daud Laghmani was replaced by Naqibullah Fayeq as Faryab governor last month.
Also on Wednesday, a Kam Air airplane was due to land in Maimana, center of the province, but it could not land due to the protests.
“There was an obstruction,” said MP Hashmatullah Arman.
Kam Air officials have said that they diverted the plane after receiving a threatening message from the control tower.
“The situation will be out of control if the demands of the people aren't met,” said Enayatullah Babur Farahmand, deputy head of the High Council of National Reconciliation

The Defense Ministry in a statement said that 20 Taliban including Amrullah, the designated district governor of Taliban for the district, were killed in Afghan forces air and ground operations in Guzargah-e-Noor, Julga and Baghlan-e-Jadid districts of Baghlan on Friday night.
Six soldiers were wounded in the attack that started at midnight, the sources said.

62,Protests in Faryab Enter 8th Day Over Governor Appointment | TOLOnews,"Protests entered the eighth day in Faryab province on Saturday as hundreds of people rallied against the appointment of the new governor.
In the latest sign of escalating tensions, protestors on Saturday took to the streets in Maimana city in front of 209 Shaheen Army Corps where a week ago Ashraf Ghani-backed governor Mohammad Daud Laghmani started his job as new governor for the province.
Some of the protesters who had shroud-like outfits warned the army corps commander of severe public outrage if he does not ask the newly appointed governor to leave the province.
“Either our leader or shroud. We are ready to defend our leader until the last drop of our blood. We do not want the governor,” said Rohullah, a protester.
“Ghani wants to impose the evil that exists in his mind about Turks in Afghanistan,” said Mohammad Qasim, a protester.
“He (Ghani) must act based on the people's demand,” said Tahmina Shuja, a protester.
Meanwhile, sources close to the National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan, or Junbish-e-Milli, led by former vice president Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum said that a number of prominent political leaders including former president Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the High Council for Reconciliation, have entered as mediators to break the deadlock between the government and Marshal Dostum.
“Work is underway on the procedures or formation of the commission or the same public council. In the next step, the people of Faryab will conduct election to appoint their governor,” said Enayatullah Babur Farahmand, a top aide to Dostum.
“It is not like he (Dostum) seizes everything. The post of a marshal, share in the cabinet and membership in the senate. What has he done for the country?” said MP Nematullah Karyab. 
The tensions erupted in Faryab province when President Ghani appointed Laghmani as new governor for the province.
Prior to Laghmani, Naqibullah Fayeq was serving in the post for three years. He was dismissed from the job last month and was offered to serve as the member of Afghanistan’s Meshrano Jirga—the senate.
Two days back, a member of the National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan said that Marshal Dostum has recommended Murad Ali Murad, the former deputy chief of army staff, to be appointed as the new governor of Faryab, but the government has reportedly rejected the offer.

69,Taliban Warns Neighbor Countries Against Hosting US Bases | TOLOnews,"Reacting to reports that the US was considering the establishment of military bases in Afghanistan’s neighboring countries, the Taliban in a statement on Tuesday warned neighboring countries against such a move, saying that the Taliban will ""not remain silent"" and ""will fulfill its religious and historical responsibilities in the same way as it has performed throughout history.""
The statement read: ""As we have repeatedly assured others that our soil will not be used against the security of others, we are similarly urging others not to use their soil and airspace against our country. If such a step is taken, then the responsibility for all the misfortunes and difficulties lies upon those who commit such mistakes.""
""God forbid, if such a step is taken once again, it will be a great historic mistake and disgrace that shall forever be inscribed as a dark stain in history,"" said the statement.
The Taliban said that if Afghanistan’s neighboring countries allow foreign bases, there would be future consequences.
Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi rejected reports that Pakistan was building military bases on its soil amid claims that the US was considering bases in Balochistan province.
“When a member of the foreign relations committee of the US Senate talks about things that Pakistan will provide them-- like air access and ground facilities--it means there is something going on behind the scenes. Although Pakistan has rejected this, it looks like a necessary option to promote friendly relations between Pakistan, the US and Afghanistan,” said Pakistani journalist Tahir Khan.
Previously, AFP quoted a US defense official saying that Pakistan had allowed the US to use Pakistan’s air space in support of US forces deployed in Afghanistan. 
“A beggar does not have the right to choose, because the owner of the house has the ability to decide. Pakistan does not have the right to choose,” said military analyst Atiqullah Amerkhel.
Fighting in Afghanistan has surged and peace talks in Doha halted following President Joe Biden's announcement that he was extending the US pullout deadline to September 11, 2021. However, there have recently been two meetings between negotiators. 
Taliban sources said that the group will attend the proposed US-led conference on Afghanistan in Turkey with three preconditions:
“The conference must be short, the agenda should not include decision-making on critical issues, and the Taliban delegation should be low level, a senior Taliban leader told VOA Tuesday. 
“Our leadership has proposed that the Istanbul meeting should not be longer than three days,” said the leader who did not want to be identified as he is not allowed to speak on the record.
“They (Taliban) come up with numerous reasons to escape from engaging in an effective dialogue,” said Mohammad Amiri, a deputy spokesman for President Ashraf Ghani.
This comes two days after the Russian special envoy for Afghanistan Zamir Kaboluv in an interview with Sputnik rejected speculations that the US was considering military bases in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.
President Joe Biden announced earlier that the complete withdrawal would be finished by September 11,  2021.
US Central Command announced on Tuesday that they estimate the US withdrawal from Afghanistan to be somewhere between 16% and 25% complete.
Approximately 160 C-17 loads of materiel and equipment have left Afghanistan, the US Department of Defense (DoD) reported, and more than 10,000 pieces of military equipment have been turned over to the Defense Logistics Agency. 
US-controlled installations in Afghanistan are also being returned to the Afghan Defense Ministry, and so far five installations have been handed back, said the DoD.

74,AP: NATO Chief Says Afghan Forces Can Cope Alone | TOLOnews,"NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says the alliance has helped provide security in Afghanistan for almost two decades, but the Afghan government and the Afghan forces are strong enough to stand on their own feet in absence of international troops’ support.
The US and coalition forces started their withdrawal on May 1. So far, nearly one-quarter of the withdrawal has been completed, according to the Pentagon.
“I think that the Afghans, they also realize that we have been there now for 20 years and we have invested heavily in blood and treasure in Afghanistan,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in an interview with The Associated Press.
“Afghanistan has come a long way, both when it comes to building strong, capable security forces, but also when it comes to social and economic progress. At some stage, it has to be the Afghans that take full responsibility for peace and stability in their own country,” Stoltenberg said in the interview.
The announcement of the withdrawal has been followed by concerns about the country’s political future. But there have been some assurances by Afghan leaders about the management of the situation with their main focus on unity among the people.
He said that NATO allies will continue to support Afghanistan through civilian experts who will help to advise government ministries, by funding the security forces and with support for slow-moving peace talks between Kabul and the Taliban. 
Stoltenberg, quoted by AP, said that NATO is also “looking into the possibility of providing some training out of country for the Afghan security forces, but no final decision has been taken.”
Violence has remained high in the country despite a three-day ceasefire from May 13 to May 15. The Defense Ministry during this week reported conflicts in at least over 12 provinces on a daily basis. 
The situation in Laghman and Baghlan in the east and north of Afghanistan has been tense over the last two weeks following Taliban attacks on Afghan forces outposts on multiple fronts. 
But in the political arena, efforts are underway to former a state council that would mainly focus on decision-making issues and consultations on the ongoing peace efforts in the country.
The State Minister on Peace Affairs on Thursday said that most of the nation’s political leaders are ready to become members of the council and to help the government in the post-withdrawal scenario.

Saraj said that 1,500 Taliban militants were killed in just one week. The Defense Ministry said Saturday that 210 Taliban fighters were killed in counterattacks by Afghan forces in 18 provinces in the last 24 hours.  
Saraj said that the pressure by Afghan forces on the Taliban has created cracks among their ranks, mounting pressure on their designated military chief Mullah Yaqub. 
“Casualties have also created major problems among their leadership. Pressure has increased on Mullah Yaqub because he has failed to use these people in their desired directions; therefore, they have started recruiting children,” Saraj said. 
Taliban has rejected the figures on their casualties. 
Saraj said that Afghan forces have managed to repel a series of Taliban’s massive offensives on a few strategic locations across the country. 
At the same news conference, National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib in response to a question about reports on Pakistan halting contacts with him, said that such reports are not true.

86,Taliban Still Closely Tied to Al Qaeda: UN Report | TOLOnews,"A report by the UN Monitoring Team released on Wednesday said that “the Taliban and Al-Qaeda remain closely aligned and show no indication of breaking ties.”
18 Member States report “no material changes to this relationship, which has grown deeper as a consequence of personal bonds of marriage and shared partnership in struggle, now cemented through second generational ties.”
This comes as foreign troops withdraw from Afghanistan and plan to leave completely by September 11.
As part of last year's agreement between the preceding Trump administration and the Taliban, the group promised to instruct its members ""not to cooperate with groups or individuals.”
“While the Doha agreement has set some expectations for a break in the longstanding relationship between the Taliban and Al Qaeda, the publicly available text of the agreement does not define expectations, and its annexes remain secret,” the report said.
According to UN member state information, “Al Qaeda is resident in at least 15 Afghan provinces, primarily in the east, southern and south-eastern regions, and are led by Al-Qaeda’s Jabhat-al-Nasr wing under the direction of Sheikh Mahmood.”
“19 Members of the group have been relocated to more remote areas by the Taliban to avoid potential exposure and targeting,” it said.
According to UN member states, “Al-Qaeda maintains contact with the Taliban but has minimized overt communications with Taliban leadership in an effort to 'lay low' and not jeopardize the Taliban’s diplomatic position vis-à-vis the Doha agreement.""
The report said that ""Member States reported that a significant part of Al Qaeda leadership remains based in the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan, where the core is joined by and works closely with Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent.""
The report stated:
“Al Qaeda’s own strategy in the near term is assessed as maintaining its traditional safe haven in Afghanistan for the Al Qaeda core leadership, the Monitoring Team takes note of assessments that have suggested a longer-term Al Qaida core strategy of strategic patience for a period of time before it would seek to plan attacks against international targets again. This scenario is untested against stated Taliban commitments to prohibit such activities.”
""Although ... Member States assess that formal communication between senior Al Qaida and Taliban officials is currently infrequent, one Member State reported that there is regular communication between the Taliban and Al-Qaeda on issues related to the peace process,” the report said.
Amid foreign troop withdrawal, the violence in Afghanistan is at its highest level in two decades.
According to the UN report, 2020 was the ""most violent year ever recorded by the United Nations in Afghanistan."" Security incidents have risen over 60% in the first three months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, the report said.

Long War Journal said that other findings by the UN are consistent with previous analyses prepared by the UN Security Council’s Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, however, the most recent report cites new intelligence as well.
One claim noted by analysts is that Sirajuddin Haqqani, the deputy emir of the Taliban’s Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, is also a member of Al Qaeda’s leadership.
“If the terrorism threat rises once again in Afghanistan or if a threat emerges to US national security from Afghanistan, in that case we want to have forces in the region to respond--to defend US national security and show a reaction,” US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said in an interview with TOLOnews on Monday.
This intelligence information was cited in a footnote, which states that in addition to being a Taliban leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani “is also assessed to be a member of the wider Al Qaeda leadership, but not of the Al Qaeda core leadership (the Hattin Shura),” the Long War Journal noted.
The UN report does not make it clear what position Sirajuddin is thought to hold within Al Qaeda’s “wider"" leadership, said the Long War Journal.
“Al Qaeda threats will not be the same as in 2001 for few years ahead,” former interior minister Gen. Massoud Andarabi said.
The Taliban did not comment on TOLOnews' questions about the claims, but previously they have rejected reports by UN monitoring teams.
“I think a (shared) interest would be in ... war affairs, or Afghanistan affairs or in fighting foreigners. I don’t think (the two groups) are united with these,” said former Taliban commander Akbar Agha.
In 2019, the Al Qaeda leader in a message mentioned Sirajuddin Haqqani and Hibatullah Akhundzada as “our leaders from the Islamic emirate of Afghanistan” and expressed gratitude for the selection of Haqqani as the deputy leader of the Taliban.

97,India Opens Channels With Taliban Leaders: Report | TOLOnews,"India for the first time opened channels of communication with Afghan Taliban leaders, including the group's deputy leader Mullah Ghani Baradar, the Hindustan Times reported on Wednesday.  
The report said the move marks “a significant shift” from New Delhi’s position of not engaging with the Taliban in any way.
The outreach is largely being led by Indian security officials and has been limited to Taliban factions and leaders that are perceived as being “nationalist” or outside the sphere of influence of Pakistan and Iran, one of the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.
The communication has been underway for some months, though it continues to be exploratory in nature, sources told the Hindustan Times. 
In the case of Mullah Baradar, the first person cited above said messages were exchanged by the two sides though there was no confirmation of a meeting, the report said. 
There have also been conversations with other Taliban factions despite a lack of trust on both sides, the sources told the Hindustan Times. 
India is the largest regional contributor to Afghanistan’s reconstruction and development efforts with pledges of $3 billion but has lagged behind other regional players such as Russia, China and Iran in establishing contacts with the Taliban, largely because of the group’s long-standing links with the Pakistani military establishment, according to the report. 
“But there has been a huge shift since then and there are some who think it might be better to have a line of communication with some Taliban leaders,” another source told the Hindustan Times.
The people who spoke to the Hindustan Times ""made it very clear that India’s outreach didn’t include the Haqqani Network or members of the Quetta Shura, who are seen as proxies of the Pakistani military."" 
There was no formal response from the Indian government to this report
A visit to Kabul last month by joint secretary JP Singh, the external affairs ministry’s point person for Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran, was part of the continuing engagement with Afghan leaders. “Singh engaged with various groups and made an assessment of the situation on the ground and got a first-hand sense of things,"" a source told the Hindustan Times.

98,Biden: US Will Not Take 'Eye Off' Terror Threat in Afghanistan | TOLOnews,"US President Joe Biden in a ""letter to certain congressional committees regarding Afghanistan"" on Tuesday said that as American troops pull out “we will not take our eye off the terrorist threat in Afghanistan.” 
“The United States will reorganize our counterterrorism capabilities and assets in the region to prevent the reemergence of a terrorist threat in Afghanistan,” Biden said. “We will hold the Taliban and the Afghan government accountable to their commitments not to allow terrorists to threaten the United States or its allies from Afghan soil.  And we will refine our national strategy to monitor and disrupt terrorist threats wherever they arise.” 
Biden in the letter said that over the past few decades, the US and its partners have trained hundreds of thousands of Afghan troops, adding that the Afghan security force members currently number close to 300,000, and “they will continue to fight valiantly to protect the Afghan citizens.” 
“With the support of the Congress, we will continue to support the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces. We will also continue to support the rights of Afghan women and girls and to maintain significant humanitarian and development assistance to Afghanistan,” he said. 
“We will continue to pursue diplomacy and fully support peace talks between the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban, facilitated by the United Nations.  And we will encourage other nations in the region, especially Pakistan, to do more to support Afghanistan and to support stability in the country,” he said. “But we will not allow United States troops to be a bargaining chip between warring parties in other countries.  That is a recipe for staying indefinitely in Afghanistan.” 
“We will withdraw responsibly, deliberately, and safely, in full coordination with our allies and partners. Our NATO allies and operational partners, who have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with us for almost 20 years and who have also made great sacrifices, will now withdraw alongside our forces as we stand by our enduring principle of “in together, out together,” Biden said. 
On April 14, Biden announced that the US troops will leave Afghanistan by September 11. Biden said he reached this conclusion ""after conducting a rigorous policy review process and consulting closely with our allies and partners, with our military leaders and intelligence personnel, with our diplomats and our development experts, with the Congress and the Vice President, and with the President of Afghanistan and many other leaders around the world.” 
“We went to Afghanistan in 2001 for a clear and just purpose: to apprehend those who attacked our country on September 11, 2001; to root out al-Qa’ida; and to prevent future attacks against the United States from Afghanistan. As a Senator, I supported sending our military to Afghanistan for those reasons. Our original mission had overwhelming support in the Congress and our allies and partners rallied to our side and stood with us in Afghanistan,” he further said. 
“We have long since accomplished the objectives that sent us to Afghanistan. It has been 10 years since we delivered justice to Osama bin Laden. The terrorist threat from al-Qa’ida in Afghanistan is significantly degraded,” he said. 
“Over the last 20 years, however, the terrorist threat to the United States has become more dispersed around the globe. Keeping thousands of troops concentrated on the ground in Afghanistan no longer makes sense as the most effective counterterrorism strategy when the threat has metastasized across the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Our focus and posture need to adapt accordingly,” he added.

100,Six Security Force Members Killed in Baghlan Car Bomb Attack | TOLOnews,"At least six security force members were killed and more than 10 others were wounded in a car bomb attack close to a military base in the northern province of Baghlan early hours of Thursday morning, sources said.
The attack took place at around 2am local time in Bagh-e-Shamal area in Pul-e-Khumri, the center of Baghlan, the source said.
“The base was also a recruitment center for the army,” the source said, adding that “some parts of the base have been destroyed in the blast.”
“After the attack, the Taliban has placed roadside mines on Baghlan-Samangan highway and also closed the road to traffic,” sources said.
Abbas Tawakoli, the commander of 3rd Brigade of 217 Pamir Army Corps, confirmed the attack and said that “it was targeted by the security forces before reaching its target.”
“After the attack, Taliban started gunfight, but their attack was pushed back by security forces,” he said. “A number of the security force members were wounded in the blast and some walls of the base were damaged.”
“The security forces clearance operation moves forward slowly in Baghlan-Samangan highway due to roadside mines,” he said.

104,Taliban: Turkey Should Withdraw Troops Under Doha Deal – Report | TOLOnews,"Amidst reports of Ankara’s proposal to guard and run Kabul’s airport after the withdrawal of US and coalition forces from the country, a Taliban spokesman has said that Turkey should pull its troops from Afghanistan under the Doha agreement, adding another layer of complexity to concerns about consequences of troop pullout.
Quoted by Reuters, Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen said that Turkey should withdraw its troops from Afghanistan under the Doha agreement.
In a text message to Reuters, Shaheen has said that Turkey should also leave Afghanistan as it has been a NATO member. 
“Turkey was part of NATO forces in the past 20 years, so as such, they should withdraw from Afghanistan on the basis of the Agreement we signed with US on 29th Feb 2020,” Shaheen said as quoted by Reuters.
“Otherwise, Turkey is a great Islamic country. Afghanistan has had historical relations with it. We hope to have close and good relations with them as a new Islamic government is established in the country in future,” he added as quoted by Reuters.
Reuters reports that the State Department and the Turkish Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The withdrawal of US and coalition forces from Afghanistan has left many with concerns about the country’s political future as well as the safety of other countries’ diplomats once all troops leave.

110,"US to 'Keep Pressure' on Daesh, Al Qaeda in Afghanistan: McKenzie | TOLOnews","The head of US Central Command, Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie, said on Sunday that the US will seek to ""keep pressure"" on Daesh and Al Qaida, the Military Times reported.
“One thing I probably need to emphasize is we will still do everything we can to keep pressure on Daesh and Al Qaeda, from our over-the-horizon locations,” McKenzie said in an interview with Military Times.
“That is a task I’ve been given. Those are plans I’m in discussion with now with the secretary of defense. How we will do that, I’ve said before, that will be a very difficult thing to do,” he said.
In response to a question about the recent UN report warning that the Taliban appeared poised to take back control of Afghanistan, McKenzie said: “We still intend to support the Afghan military from just over the horizon. We’re still going to support them with funding.”
“We’re going to try very hard to support the Afghan air force over the horizon; some things will come out of the country to be worked on,” he said. “I don’t want to minimize this, because I think they’re going to be tested, but we will continue to support them, just not in the way we are supporting them now.”
He said: “The fighting is seesaw right now. You know we will do everything we can to help the Afghans going forward within the limits that we have, which is, of course, no boots on the ground. But it’s gonna be really on their shoulders now to stand or fall, and I think they have a fighting chance to do it. That’s what I’ve said before, and we’ll do everything we can to help them.”
Asked if the US would provide any combat support to Afghan forces if major cities such as Kabul were at risk of being overrun, he said: “Those are actually, as you will appreciate, policy decisions, not military decisions. I will tell you this. Right now what we’re planning to do after we withdraw is keep pressure on Al Qaida and Daesh, and that would be what we’d be doing, going back into Afghanistan.”
“When those entities presented actionable threats against the United States, we’d be prepared to go in there and take action if our Afghan partners are unable to do that, and that will be the limit of our kinetic actions in Afghanistan,” he said.
Asked about China and Russia stepping up efforts in Afghanistan, McKenzie said: “The Chinese, I think they would like to get in for the mass mineral deposits that exist on the ground in Afghanistan and in other places, and that’s their interest.”
“I think the Russians have concerns about the spread of terror north through the Stans into Russia. I think both are interested in it. None of them have been particularly supportive of us while we’ve been there, and if we leave, I think they will try to move in to fill what they perceive to be a vacuum,” he said.
“They may find that to be harder than they think, though, to actually accomplish,” he added.
In April US President Joe Biden announced that US troops will leave Afghanistan by September 11.

113,UN Plans for Increase of Displaced Afghans After Troop Pullout | TOLOnews,"The United Nations is preparing for a likely further displacement of civilians in Afghanistan after US and international troops leave the country in September, UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi said on Monday as quoted by Reuters.
Violence has remained high in the country over the last two months, leading to the displacement of thousands of families in northern and southern Afghanistan. 
He cited an attack on deminers last week in Baghlan province. 
“This is a tragic indicator of the type of violence that may be resurfacing in Afghanistan, and with the withdrawal of the international troops this is possibly or likely going to become worse,” he said as quoted by Reuters. 
“Therefore,” he said, “we are doing contingency planning inside the country for further displacement in the neighboring countries in case people might cross borders.” 
According to UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR), there are currently some 2.5 million registered refugees from Afghanistan globally, while another 4.8 million have been displaced within the country. 
Grandi said strong international support was needed for peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban. 
“It's political action that should substitute conflict but, of course, the risk (of further displacement) is there and we need to be prepared,” he added as quoted by Reuters. 
Earlier this month the United States announced more than $266 million in new humanitarian aid for Afghanistan, bringing to nearly $3.9 billion the total amount of such aid it has provided since 2002.

They criticized the government for not identifying those responsible for the crimes.
Both victims started school together as little girls, became friends as adolescents and completed their university studies together as well. Zainab was 26 and Suhaila was 25.
“They were friends for twelve years, they were very close to each other, we had family relations,” said Fatima, the mother of Suhaila.
“How long will this bloodshed continue? May God bless us with peace,” said Hussnia, the mother of Zaiban.
“No one is there to hear our voice, no one is there to come and respond to us, why should they (civilians) be killed?"" said Ghulam Reza, father of Suhaila.
“Everyday explosions target cars, minivans and busses, why are our educated youths being killed?” said Assadullah Musavi, father of Zainab.
Zainab was expected to travel to Japan for her master's degree in the near future.
In recent weeks, at least 10 attacks have targeted civilians in the western part of Kabul.
Two explosions hit civilian cars in Kabul on Saturday killing at least 6 people and wounding 7 more.
No group or individual has claimed responsibility for the attack.

122,6 Tribal Elders in Badghis Arrested for Aiding Taliban | TOLOnews,"Afghan authorities on Wednesday said that at least six tribal elders were arrested for acting as go-betweens in agreements that led to government forces leaving their posts to the Taliban in various parts of Badghis province.
Hessamuddin Shams, the governor of Badghis province, said that the tribal elders played a key role in paving the way for dozens of soldiers to leave their posts.
“We have arrested at least six influential people who were involved in mediating between the security forces and the Taliban to evacuate their bases,” said Shams.
Meanwhile, local officials in Badghis have also said that at least 50 soldiers who made agreements with the Taliban to leave have returned to their bases.
This comes days after authorities warned that those who mediate between the security forces and the Taliban will be arrested.
“This is a very bad tradition in Afghanistan that needs to be prevented ... the people come and ask the security forces to surrender to the Taliban, these people should face the law,” said MP Ziauddin Akazi.
“The government maintains the right to take action against every person who is involved in disrupting the system,” said civil society activist Junaidullah Ashkani.
Recently several soldiers surrendered to the Taliban without any resistance. Jond is a district in Badghis that has been under siege by the Taliban for more than a decade. Jond fell to the Taliban a few days ago.

123,"Biden and Putin Agree to Steps on Cybersecurity, Arms Control | TOLOnews","US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on Wednesday to begin cybersecurity and arms control talks at a summit that highlighted their discord on those issues, human rights and Ukraine. 
In their first meeting since he took office in January, Biden asked Putin how he would feel if a ransomware attack hit Russia's oil network, a pointed question making reference to the May shutdown of a pipeline that caused disruptions and panic-buying along the US East Coast. 
While Biden stressed that he did not make threats during the three-hour meeting, he said he outlined US interests, including cybersecurity, and made clear to Putin that the United States would respond if Russia infringed on those concerns. 
Both men used careful pleasantries to describe their talks in a lakeside Swiss villa, with Putin calling them constructive and without hostility and Biden saying there was no substitute for face-to-face discussions. 
They also agreed to send their ambassadors back to each other's capitals. Russia recalled its envoy after Biden said in March that he thought Putin was a ""killer."" The United States recalled its ambassador soon after. 
Putin said on Wednesday that he had been satisfied by Biden’s explanation of the remark. 
But there was no hiding their differences on issues such as human rights, where Biden said the consequences for Russia would be ""devastating"" if jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny died, or cyberspace, where Washington has demanded Moscow crack down on ransomware attacks emanating from Russian soil. 
""I looked at him and said: 'How would you feel if ransomware took on the pipelines from your oil fields?' He said: 'It would matter,'"" Biden told reporters at an unusual solo news conference, itself an illustration of the tensions between the two nations. 
The query referred to a cyberattack that closed the Colonial Pipeline Co system for several days in May, preventing millions of barrels of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from flowing to the East Coast from the Gulf Coast. 
Biden also vowed to take action against any Russian cyberattacks: ""I pointed out to him that we have significant cyber capability. And he knows it."" 
'THIS IS NOT ABOUT TRUST' 
Speaking to reporters before Biden, Putin dismissed US concerns about Navalny, Russia's increased military presence near Ukraine's eastern border and US suggestions that Russians were responsible for the cyberattacks on the United States. 
He also suggested Washington was in no position to lecture Moscow on rights, batting away question about his crackdown on political rivals by saying he was trying to avoid the ""disorder"" of a popular movement, such as Black Lives Matter. 
""What we saw was disorder, disruption, violations of the law, etc. We feel sympathy for the United States of America, but we don’t want that to happen on our territory and we'll do our utmost in order to not allow it to happen,” he said. 
He also seemed to question the legitimacy of arresting the rioters who attacked the US Capitol on Jan. 6, seeking to stop Biden’s certification as president after he beat his predecessor, Donald Trump, in the November election by over 7 million votes. 
Biden said any comparison between what happened on Jan. 6 and the Black Lives Matter movement was “ridiculous.” 
US-Russia relations have been deteriorating for years, notably with Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, its 2015 intervention in Syria and US charges - denied by Moscow - of meddling in the 2016 election won by Trump. 
Neither side gave details on how their planned cybersecurity talks might unfold, although Biden said he told Putin that critical infrastructure should be “off-limits” to cyberattacks, saying that included 16 sectors that he did not publicly identify. 
""We need some basic rules of the road that we can all abide by,"" Biden said he had told Putin. 
Biden said he raised human rights issues because it was in the ""DNA"" of his country to do so, and also because of the fate of US citizens jailed in Russia. 
Putin said he believed some compromises could be found, although he gave no indication of any prisoner exchange deal. 
Putin, 68, called Biden, 78, a constructive, experienced partner, and said they spoke ""the same language."" But he added that there had been no friendship, rather a pragmatic dialogue about their two countries' interests. 
""President Biden has miscalculated who he is dealing with,"" said US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who is close to Trump. He called it ""disturbing"" to hear Biden suggest that Putin cared about his standing in the world. 
Trump was accused by both Democrats and some Republicans of not being tough enough on Putin, particularly during a jovial 2018 meeting in Helsinki between the two leaders. 
This time, there were separate news conferences and no shared meal. 
Both Biden and Putin said they shared a responsibility, however, for nuclear stability, and would hold talks on possible changes to their recently extended New START arms limitation treaty. 
In February, Russia and the United States extended New START for five years. The treaty caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads they can deploy and limits the land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers to deliver them. 
A senior US official told reporters that Biden, Putin, their foreign ministers and interpreters met first for 93 minutes. After a break, the two sides met for 87 minutes in a larger group including their ambassadors. 
Putin said it was ""hard to say"" if relations would improve, but that there was a ""glimpse of hope."" 
“This is not about trust, this is about self-interest and verification of self-interest,” Biden said, but he also cited a “genuine prospect” of improving relations.

Local officials in Herat said the Afghan National Security and Defense Forces (ANDSF) fought bravely and repulsed the Taliban attack.
“Lack of coordination between the security forces is a serious problem. There is a need for a unified command and control center to provide morale to the security forces. The Taliban are using these gaps and then launching attacks,” said Ghulam Habib Hashemi, a member of Herat’s security committee.

127,Militant Groups in Afghanistan Could Pose Threat to US: Officials | TOLOnews,"Top Pentagon officials on Thursday said that militant groups like al Qaeda could pose a threat from Afghanistan to the United States and American allies in two years after the full withdrawal of international troops from the country.
US President Joe Biden’s decision to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan in the next few months has been accompanied by concerns about Afghanistan’s future, especially when it comes to containing threats from terrorist groups in the country.
“It would take possibly two years for them to develop that capability,” US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said during a congressional hearing on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Gen. Mark Milley, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he agreed with the timeline and said there was a medium risk at the moment.
“If there was a collapse of the government or a dissolution of the Afghan security forces, that risk would obviously increase,” Milley said.
The remarks come as a UN report in January said there are at least 500 al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan and that the Taliban maintains a close relationship with the group. The Taliban has denied having ties with al Qaeda.
Also, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan meanwhile said on Thursday that they take the issue seriously that militant groups in Afghanistan will pose threat to the west.
“Obviously, we take seriously the concern that the Taliban or other elements in Afghanistan will attack the Western — or the international presence — diplomatic presence or security presence in and around Kabul. That’s why we are putting together a detailed and effective security plan,” Sullivan said.
This comes as violence has intensified following the start of the withdrawal of US and coalition forces from Afghanistan. A parliamentary committee on Thursday reported fighting on 200 fronts across the country in just a day. Moreover, at least 30 districts have fallen to the Taliban in the last two months.

“We are thankful for that generous and costly global endeavor. We are now at a point where we not only need to end our internal conflict through political means, but we still need to be vigilant and assure resilience as well as containment as part of a paradigm shift that can assure peace and an acceptable and inclusive end-state for the people of Afghanistan,” he said. 
This comes as violence has intensified following the start of the withdrawal of US and coalition forces from Afghanistan. A parliamentary committee on Thursday reported fighting on 200 fronts across the country in just a day. Moreover, at least 30 districts have fallen to the Taliban in the last two months.

Abdullah said there clear are indications that show that the Taliban are trying to advance militarily before the withdrawal of foreign forces from the country.
“The point is that it will have an implication, an impact on the negotiations with the Taliban. Taliban may find themselves further emboldened and they may think, some of them at least, that with the withdrawal they can take advantage of the situation militarily, so why to get seriously into the negotiations?"",” said Abdullah in an interview with AP.
Abdullah however warned the Taliban not to miscalculate the situation, saying that no one will be able to win militarily.
“It will be a big miscalculation on part of the Taliban should they think that they can win militarily, and I repeat that there are no winners through the continuation of the war,” he added in the interview.
Meanwhile, Qatar’s Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said that there has been no breakthrough in the peace negotiations between the Afghan parties so far.

133,Qureshi Rejects Taliban Sanctuaries in Pakistan | TOLOnews,"Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said the only way forward toward peace in Afghanistan is through reconciliation, coexistence and talks among Afghans, and he reiterated that Islamabad’s approach toward its neighbor has changed and it will favor a future arrangement that is acceptable for all Afghans. 
Talking to TOLOnews in an exclusive interview at his office in Islamabad last week, Qureshi said there is a need for flexibility from Afghan leaders to move the peace process forward.
Qureshi rejected Taliban sanctuaries in Pakistan and said most of their leaders “are in Afghanistan” and when asked about the presence of Quetta and Peshawar Shuras, or councils, he denied the existence of such institutions in Pakistan and said he “has been hearing of these terms for now decades.”
Asked whether Taliban are ""funded here in Pakistan,"" Qureshi said: “These are very--those many things that have been going on for years. You’re stuck in the old groove. Get of out that groove, please. Get out of that groove. Now, listen, if you remain stuck in this, believe me you will not be able to travel far. And we want you to travel far. We want reconciliation and peace.”
Qureshi, seemingly skeptical about further progress in the peace process under the current circumstances, said President Ghani has ""a very important responsibility on his shoulders"" and he must ""show the leadership and the flexibility” necessary to achieve progress in the peace process.
Qureshi mentioned Doha as the best place for engaging in talks with the Taliban--even between the leaders of both sides--but said this will not happen unless there is willingness from both sides.
“What has changed is Pakistan’s approach,” Qureshi stressed. “We want Afghanistan to be peaceful and stable because we feel that a peaceful Afghanistan, a stable Afghanistan, gives us the regional connectivity that is required.”
“If we’re looking for economic security and if we’re looking for investments and the promotion of bilateral trade and regional trade, it can only come with peace, and peace and stability Afghanistan is not just Afghanistan’s requirement, it’s Pakistan’s desire as well. You know, we benefit from it,” he said.
According to Qureshi, the world’s approach has changed as it does not hold the view that peace can be achieved through a military solution.
“We have been advocating for years that there is no military solution to the Afghan conflict. What has changed is this new approach that what is required is a negotiated political settlement that we were advocating. This international environment has changed and that has been the environment more conducive for peace today than ever before.""
In response to a question on what type of a government Pakistan would favor as an outcome of the peace process, Qureshi said it is a decision to be made by Afghans.
“That’s for the people of Afghanistan to decide--who governs them and what kind of a political dispensation Afghanistan wants,” he said. “What we’re saying is you are all Afghans. Peace can only come to Afghanistan if you sit and reconcile. When you sit and reconcile, when you sit and talk, you will determine what kind of constitution we want, what kind of, you know, system should be in place.”
He said that Pakistan suggests an inclusive system that would be helpful in reconciliation and promoting the peace process.
“We’re willing to help; we’re willing to help in pushing forward the peace process, and as you know we’ve facilitated the peace process and there is acknowledgement of that. We’re willing to help in Afghanistan’s reconstruction, rehabilitation. We’re willing to partner with Afghanistan, with the US, on countering terrorism. Yes, we will be partners for peace,” he said.
When asked about the status of the Afghan peace process and progress in this respect, Qureshi said it should be asked of Afghans.
“The peace process has to come to its logical conclusion through an intra-Afghan negotiation. We’re not sitting at the table with them. Wherever required, we’ve facilitated. We cannot decide for you. It’s the Afghans that will sit and decide what they want,” he said.
Taliban-Pakistan Nexus 
Qureshi said that Taliban leaders and those who have attended the Doha negotiations, including Mullah Baradar, have been visiting talks “for facilitating the peace process,” and he reiterated that most Taliban leaders “are in Afghanistan.”
“They (Taliban leaders) go to Doha. They have been traveling to other places, they went to Moscow, they went to other places,” Qureshi said.
Referring to Taliban leaders, he said, they’re in Afghanistan and the Afghans “need to engage with them.”
“We’re only engaging with them to facilitate the peace process,” he said. “We’re trying to be helpful. We’re trying to be constructive.”
Qureshi said that Pakistan has “always advocated reduction in violence leading to ceasefire because we genuinely believe that you cannot have negotiations and violence go hand in hand.”
Qureshi indirectly hinted that he does not see the Taliban as responsible for the high level of violence in Afghanistan.
“Who is responsible for that?” Qureshi said when he was asked about the rise in Taliban violence. “If you try (to) create this impression that the violence is high because of Taliban, again, that would be an exaggeration.”
He said there are other elements like Daesh “who are playing the role of a spoiler.”
He said that violence has to go down and the process of peace and negotiations has to accelerate.
He said he thinks that the Taliban are ready for peace and that “they have suffered as well.”
Qureshi said that he has talked with those Taliban leaders who are in talks with Afghans.
“I am talking to exactly the people you are talking to. The people you are talking to in Doha, the people you are talking to while sitting across the table, same people. I feel they also realize that they have suffered and they have paid a huge price. And it’s their country. They are not foreigners,” he said.
Qureshi said that Pakistan remains concerned that Afghanistan will be plunged into another civil war, but he hopes it will not happen.
“That’s why I’m saying, please sit together and carve out a way forward, you know, which is coexistence, reconciliation. Accept each other. You have to accept each other,” he asked.
In response to a question about whether the country is moving toward a civil war, Qureshi said it depends on the Afghan leadership.
“It depends on you, depends on the Afghan leadership, depends on the ability of the Afghan leadership to carve a way forward. If you fail, if the Afghan leadership fail, then yes, we are heading for a civil war,” he added.
Afghanistan-Pakistan Relations
Qureshi said that Pakistan wants a sovereign, democratic and peaceful Afghanistan.
“Bilateral relationships are mutual. Both sides have to see a benefit in it, and we do see. We see benefit in good relations with Afghanistan,” Qureshi said.
But he added that “Pakistan is not responsible for the squabbling that is going on in Afghanistan.”
“Pakistan is not responsible if the Afghan leadership cannot sit and work out a peace deal. We’re not responsible for that. It’s yours. We’re saying we want to be helpful.”
Regarding the Durand Line, specifically, whether it is a recognized border, Qureshi said: “If we want to move ahead and sort of coexist as good neighbors that we desire then I think let’s accept the international border.”
India-Pakistan Ties
Qureshi said that India has a presence in Afghanistan that is ""larger than it ought to be"" because it does not share a border with Afghanistan. He said that India uses its presence to conduct “subversive activities” in Pakistan.
Qureshi said that officially India has four consulates in Afghanistan, but indirectly hinted there are more unofficial ones.
“At times we feel that you don’t share a border with India. Obviously, you have sovereign relations and you have bilateral relations and you have every right to have sovereign and bilateral relations with India. You trade with India, they come and carry out development work there. That’s fine, that’s completely fine with us. But at times we feel that their presence is perhaps larger than it ought to be because they don’t share a border with you.”
He said it bothers Pakistan if Afghan soil is used against it by India.
He said that under Prime Minister Imran Khan, they took initiatives toward peace with India, but it was not reciprocated by New Delhi.
“They took steps and measures that vitiated the climate,” Qureshi said, referring to India. “Despite that, we think that the situation in occupied Jammu and Kashmir is a political situation, it is being mishandled.”
Qureshi meanwhile rejected reports about Pakistan’s willingness to allow US bases to operate on Pakistani soil after American forces leave Afghanistan. He said it will never be possible.
Regarding US withdrawal, he said the United States believes that it has achieved its objective in Afghanistan and that it is leaving the country.

134,"If Taliban 'Wants Enmity', Will Face 'Serious Response’: Ghani | TOLOnews","The Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Saturday warned that “if the Taliban want enmity than they will face a serious response.” 
While introducing the new ministerial nominees for the Ministries of Defense and Interior, President Ghani said the Taliban should decide in what way they want to proceed: by seeking a political solution or continuing ""enmity."" 
“The Taliban must choose: do you want to be in the future based on a lasting and just peace based on a political solution with dignity or do you want enmity, to which this nation will give a strong response? No one should doubt this,” he said.
President Ghani criticized the recent Taliban attacks on various parts of the country--and the targeting of civilians.
Addressing the Taliban, he said: ""Why are you targeting public facilities, bridges and small bridges? Why are you placing roadside mines that kill women and children?” 
""Why are you burning schools and the district governor office? Isn't the answer as clear as the sun? Do you work for others?” he mentioned. 
Meanwhile, he said that the new changes in the Ministries of National Defense and Interior are intended to strengthen the security institutions. 
""We all know that martyrdom on the way to the homeland is an honor, but we want life, not death for a country that is deprived of it's most basic right, which is peace.
""There is a clear need for a national, regional and international dialogue to be implemented across the country, the region and the world to say: “Is 43 years (of war) not enough?” he said. 
""Here we must conclude that we will not surrender to the terrorists, we will not surrender to the grim plans, we are the future-makers, we are shaping the future,"" he added. 
Doubts over the Taliban’s intentions for a political settlement 
Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, said that he has grave concerns that the Taliban will not show any flexibility for a political agreement with the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan once the US troops leave the country. 
Abdullah said there are clear indications that the Taliban are trying to advance militarily before the withdrawal of foreign forces from the country. 
“The point is that it will have an implication, an impact on the negotiations with the Taliban. The Taliban may find themselves further emboldened and they may think, some of them at least, that with the withdrawal they can take advantage of the situation militarily, so why to get seriously into the negotiations?"" said Abdullah in an interview with AP. 
Abdullah however warned the Taliban not to miscalculate the situation, saying that no one will be able to win militarily. 
“It will be a big miscalculation on part of the Taliban should they think that they can win militarily, and I repeat that there are no winners through the continuation of the war,” he added in the interview.

136,Taliban Deputy Leader Baradar Calls for Doha Deal Implementation | TOLOnews,"Taliban deputy leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar said that to achieve progress in the peace negotiations there is a need for the implementation of the Doha agreement. His statement comes amid ramped-up fighting across the country and the fall of dozens of districts to the Taliban.
Baradar, in an article published Sunday on the group's website, stressed the importance of protecting citizens' rights based on the teachings of Islam. He wrote that the group wants the establishment of a “real Islamic system” in Afghanistan. 
Baradar, who also heads the Taliban’s office in Doha, said that the release of the remaining prisoners and the removal of Taliban leaders from the UN blacklist are important for progress in the peace negotiations. 
“A real Islamic system is the best tool for solving all the problems faced by Afghans,” Baradar writes, “And it is the only demand for which all layers of Afghan society are united and do not oppose.”
He said that Afghans want “a powerful Islamic system to protect Afghanistan from invasion and the interference of foreigners and also to assure the world of peace in Afghanistan.”
He faintly referenced women’s rights, saying the group sees itself as committed to the rights of all Afghans--men and women--under Islamic teachings in light of desirable Afghan traditions. 
But Hizb-e-Islami leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar in an interview with TOLOnews on Sunday said that the Taliban so far has no clear definition of an Islamic system and has not clarified whether they will accept an election under a future government. 
“So far, unfortunately, The Taliban has failed to have a clear definition and interpretation about a future government in which the details of the system, the leader and the role of the people are specified,” Hekmatyar said.
The Presidential Palace, meanwhile, called the Taliban remarks a trick.
“They are not sincere in their remarks. They only want to deceive the people of Afghanistan,” a presidential spokesman Mohammad Amiri said. 
Meanwhile, Hekmatyar in an opinion piece--a copy of which was sent to TOLOnews--blamed the Afghan government and the Taliban for the lack of a plan in the Doha negotiations. He said that success from the Doha agreement will not be possible.
“The details of the Doha talks, in terms of the formation of the delegation and its venue, should change. The talks should change to another place,” Hekmatyar said.
The Doha negotiations are currently locked in a stalemate while fighting is reported in 24 provinces in the last 24 hours.

143,US Can Provide Over-the-Horizon Support to Afghanistan: Pentagon | TOLOnews,"The US military “can already provide the over-the-horizon support that the Afghan government will need,” Pentagon spokesman John F. Kirby said Monday, adding that the United States leaders continually assess the progress of the retrograde from Afghanistan and the state of operations in the country and adjust accordingly. 
“Those capabilities already exist. Leaders are looking for better ways to perform the missions,” Kirby said. “Other aspects of the Afghan situation are still being studied. Commanders at many levels are wrestling with what over-the-horizon counterinsurgency and over-the-horizon logistics will look like.”  
He said the US leaders continually assess the progress of the retrograde from Afghanistan and the state of operations in the country and adjust accordingly.  
Kirby said that US defense secretary and military leaders in the Pentagon, at US Central Command and in Afghanistan, “are constantly looking at the pace we’re going at, and the capabilities we have, and the capabilities that we're going to need throughout to complete the withdrawal.”  
“So as we said, from the very beginning; while there is a schedule, we are mindful that that schedule could fluctuate and change, as conditions change,” he further said. 
Kirby said there are only two aspects of the Afghanistan retrograde that will not change: “The first is the US military will withdraw all US forces from the country, and the second is the withdrawal will be finished by the September deadline set by President Joe Biden.” 
Austin has extended the aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower in the region. He has deployed a bomber task force to the area.  
“Nobody is discounting how difficult this is,” Kirby said. “But as the secretary said, difficult does not mean impossible, and we have the ability right now to reach any scrap of Earth that we believe we need to, should the risk warrant it.” 
Planners continue to look at ways to provide contractual support to Afghan forces once the retrograde is completed.   
“There's a range of options that we're looking at for how to continue to provide contractual support … specifically the Afghan Air Forces,” Kirby said. “We’re very actively working our way through that right now. We're looking at a range of options.”

144,Khan Says Taliban Cannot Win Over the Whole of Afghanistan | TOLOnews,"Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan in an op-ed published by The Washington Post has said that his country opposes any military takeover of Afghanistan and that “the Taliban cannot win over the whole of the country, and yet must be included in any government for it to succeed.” 
Taliban has intensified their attacks on Afghan forces over the last two months, especially when the US President Joe Biden announced the withdrawal of American forces from the country by September 11. 
At least 50 districts have either fallen to the Taliban or have remained contested between the two sides over the last two months – many of them without resistance by security forces. Sources told TOLOnews that many districts have fallen due to delay in deployment of reinforcements. 
Khan said Pakistan is ready to be a partner for peace in Afghanistan with the United States — but as US troops withdraw, “we will avoid risking further conflict.” 
Similar remarks were made by Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in an interview with TOLOnews last week. He said Pakistan wants to partner with Afghanistan in the peace process. 
“Our countries have the same interest in that long-suffering country,” Khan said. 
“In the past, Pakistan made a mistake by choosing between warring Afghan parties, but we have learned from that experience,” Khan reiterated in the op-ed. 
Back in Kabul, there are doubts among analysts and lawmakers in Pakistan’s approach towards Afghanistan especially when it comes to bringing the Taliban to the table of negotiations.  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Sunday told TOLOnews that Pakistan should use its leverage on Taliban as an essential tool to help the Afghan peace process. 
The ministry said there is a need for Pakistan’s sincere cooperation and the implementation of its commitments to Afghanistan to achieve peace in the country.

154,'Infiltrators' Had Role in Fall of Districts in Paktia: Governor | TOLOnews,"Paktia governor Haleem Fedayee, on Thursday said that Taliban infiltrators in the ranks of the security forces played a key role in the fall of the districts to the Taliban.
Also, a number of tribal elders helped the Taliban take over the districts, Fedayee said. 
Meanwhile, residents in Paktia have expressed alarm over the security forces leaving their checkpoints without resistance.
The centers of nine districts have fallen to the Taliban in the past one week.
“The presence of infiltrators among the tribal elders and the security forces in this situation is very perilous, this will have negative consequences,” said Haleem Fedayee, governor of Paktia.
“Some agents among the tribal elders and the security forces wanted to demoralize the security forces, but the morale of the security forces is very high,” said Yarbaz Hamidi, MP from Paktia.
“When the Taliban arrived, they were large in number; the tribal elders started mediation and the entire security forces surrendered and handed over their military equipment,” said Baryalai Maftoon, a resident of Zazai Aryoub district in Paktia.
Paktia has 14 districts. The centers of nine districts including Janikhel, Dand-e-Pathan, Samkanai, Zazai Aryoub, Ahmadkhel, Lazhamangal, Mirzaka, Sayed Karam and Rohani Baba have fallen to the Taliban.

158,US to Keep Hundreds of Troops After Withdrawal: AP | TOLOnews,"At least 650 US troops are expected to remain in Afghanistan to provide security for diplomats following the completion of the American force withdrawal from the country, The Associated Press reported on Thursday, quoting US officials.
This comes amidst a sharp rise in Taliban attacks on Afghan forces that have led to the fall of many districts to the group. But, on the other hand, thousands of Afghans have taken up arms to support the security forces in the fight against the Taliban.
The Associated Press quotes US officials as saying that says that several hundred additional US troops will remain at the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, potentially until September, as a temporary move until a more formal Turkey-led security operation is in place.
Quoted by The Associated Press the US officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said that overall, the US expects to have American and coalition military command, its leadership and most troops out by July Fourth, or shortly after that, meeting an aspirational deadline that commanders developed months ago.
This comes as US Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday met with President Ashraf Ghani, Abdullah Abdullah Chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation and other Afghan officials who accompany the president in his two-day visit to the United States.
In the meeting with President Ghani at the Capitol, McConnell said he hopes President Biden will delay the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan.
“As President Ghani and the Afghan people know, the threats we face from terrorism and tyranny have not been defeated,” he said.
Meanwhile, US Senator Jim Risch, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in a meeting with Afghan leaders also expressed his concerns about the situation in Afghanistan and said “there are options in-between departing Afghanistan entirely or remaining there forever.”
“I am concerned this decision severely hampers any chances of a negotiated peace, and puts our hard-fought counterterrorism gains at risk,” Risch said.
US and coalition forces started withdrawal from Afghanistan in May. According to US Central Command, over 50 percent of the withdrawal has been completed.

159,US Assessing Whether Taliban Is Serious About Peace: Blinken | TOLOnews,"As the Taliban’s attacks continue in many provinces in the country, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that Washington is assessing whether the group is serious about ending the conflict in Afghanistan.
Quoted in a report by Reuters, Blinken said that trying to take back the country by force is not consistent with peace efforts.
Afghan Defense Ministry on Friday said that six districts were retaken from the Taliban since Thursday evening. Meanwhile, the Afghan peace process has stalled as the clashes between security forces and the Taliban remain at their highest level in the last two months.
Some members of the Afghan Republic’s negotiating team are still in Doha. The two sides – the Republic and the Taliban negotiators – held two meetings this month at the contact group level to discuss the possibility of future meetings between the two delegations. However, there hasn’t been tangible progress in resuming the stalled negotiations.
“We are looking very carefully at the security on the ground in Afghanistan and we’re also looking very hard at whether the Taliban is, at all, serious about a peaceful resolution of the conflict,” Blinken told a joint news conference with France's foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, as quoted in Reuters report.

161,Hundreds Take Up Arms Across Afghanistan in Support of ANDSF | TOLOnews,"Hundreds of people, many of them armed, on Friday poured into streets in 10 provinces of the country to raise their voice in support of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), announcing their preparation to fight the Taliban.
Those who rallied on streets said they will not allow the Taliban to take over their villages.
In northern Takhar province, a number of women went to the frontline where they distributed food and fruits to the security forces who are battling the Taliban in the area.
“It will be good if we Afghans sit together instead of killing each other,” said Mohammad Asher Arab, a tribal elder from Takhar.
“As well as in Farkhar district, the security forces in cooperation with the people dealt major blow to the enemy,” Takhar Police Chief Ekramuddin Sari said.
The northern province of Sar-e-Pul is one of the provinces where the Taliban has taken over several districts. Many residents of the province have taken up arms to fight the Taliban.
“We are taking up arms to mobilize the second generation of resistance to fight against the dark regime of the Taliban, so we will defend until the last drop of our blood,” said Ghulam Sakhi, a resident in Ghor province.
“We will wait until next week. If the lost territory is not retaken by the security forces, we will act on our own,” said Mohammad Noor Rahmani, the head of Ghor provincial council.
In Khost province, dozens of residents have taken up arms to fight the Taliban.
At least 200 residents of Zabul led by governor Hamidullah Tokhi have taken up arms for the fight against the Taliban, local officials said.
Moreover, some influential political figures have mobilized hundreds of armed men to support the Afghan forces on the battlefields.
“No one should think that with these takeovers, the Taliban has been equipped and will transfer the tanks to Punjab,” Deputy Minister of Interior Naqibullah Fayeq, who has traveled to Baghlan, said.

164,Taliban Trying to Take Military Equipment to Pakistan: Official | TOLOnews,"A senior Afghan security official claimed that the Taliban is making efforts to take military equipment, including tanks, to Pakistan -- as the group continues to take over various districts, security outposts and military bases that house dozens of vehicles, tanks and others.
Acting Interior Minister Gen. Abdul Sattar Mirzakwal who visited the eastern province of Paktia on Saturday said his remarks were based on intelligence information he has received.
“There is also information that the Taliban take some (military) tanks to Pakistan through Zabul province (in southern Afghanistan),” the acting interior minister said. “The National Security Council and the commander in chief have ordered permanent patrols to target any tank that is tried to be taken to Pakistan.”
Another high-ranking official at the same event echoed the minister's remarks by saying that some military equipment has been transferred across the Durand Line – the de facto border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
“They have taken military equipment owned by security forces across the Durand Line,” said Shamim Khan Katawazai, head of the Independent Directorate of Local Governance. “There are evidence and footage about this. Pakistani soldiers have clicked photos with them.”
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid rejected the claims on the transfer of military equipment by the group to Pakistan.
This comes as heavy fighting is underway in Paktia between security forces and the Taliban for the last week. Security forces retook Ahmad Aba and Mirzaka districts in Paktia from the Taliban in the last three days.
Paktia officials said that they have arrested Pakistani nationals who fought in the ranks of the Taliban during their operations. 
Mirzaka district fell to the Taliban three days ago. Most parts of the district, especially government buildings, have been damaged in the clashes or have been set on fire as officials described.
Local officials claimed that the Taliban ""has set ablaze"" many security outposts and have ""destroyed"" some roads.
“Unfortunately, they (Taliban) burn and destroyed government establishments. They don’t have another message,” Paktia governor Halim Fedaee said.
The 203 Corps Commander Gen. Jalaluddin Yaftali said that military operations are underway to retake seven Paktia districts that have fallen to the Taliban.
“They have made destructions in all districts,” Gen. Yaftali said. “They have broken glasses. They have set ablaze some establishments.”
Taliban has rejected the claims by security officials.
Paktia has 14 districts. At least 10 of them have fallen to the Taliban recently, but three, including Ahmad Aba, Mirzaka and Sayed Karam, were retaken while the group still has influence over Janikhil, Dand-e-Patan, Samkanai, Zazai Aryub, Ahmadkhil, Lazha Mangal and Rouhani Baba districts.

They told me that tanks will come, I said they will not fire. I asked them not to open fire. But they opened fire and I escaped with my nephew but he was martyred,” Azim said. 
Some public uprising forces who have gone to Pul-e-Khumri city from Narin district in Baghlan said they have been stationed in the Band-e-Do area to prevent the Taliban from entering the northern city.

All sections of our society have decided that Pakistan will take no military action.”

Then we will seal the border because now we can, because we have fenced our border, which was previously [open], because Pakistan does not want to get into, number one, conflict, secondly, we do not want another influx of refugees.” 
Khan said that after the US withdrawal, he wished that Pakistan and the US could fix their “lopsided” equation of the past.

Bismillah Mohammadi on Monday assured his forces on the battlefield in the central province of Maidan Wardak that the Taliban cannot win through their military campaign and reiterated that war is not the solution to ensure peace in the country. 
Mohammadi visited the volatile province of Maidan Wardak on Monday where he said that now the people, too, are ready to fight against the Taliban in support of the security and defense forces. 
“War is not the solution,” he said. “If it was a solution, it would have shown its results in the last 20 years.”
He added: “Therefore if they (Taliban) want to win militarily and impose violence on the people of Afghanistan, they would take this dream to the grave. They should realize that it is not possible through violence.”
Parwan, Maidan Wardak, Logar and Laghman are the four neighboring provinces of Kabul where some districts have fallen to the Taliban in the last two months. But operations have been launched to retake these areas from the group.
“It would be a bitter experience for the Talibs if they want to repeat their past once again,” Maidan Wardak governor Lawang Faizan said.
Taliban offensives intensified after the announcement of the withdrawal of US and coalition forces in April. Figures collected by TOLOnews show that over 100 districts have fallen to the Taliban in the last two months. 11 districts have been retaken by security forces.
The fall of districts in Kabul’s neighboring provinces has created concerns among residents of the capital city, but security forces on the frontlines pledged that they will continue their efforts to push back Taliban attacks in those areas.
In Parwan province in the north of Kabul, a group of public uprising forces has joined the security forces on the frontlines in the Dara-e-Ghorband area to prevent the Taliban from reaching the city of Charikar that lies 60 kilometers to the north of Kabul.

181,Italian Forces Hand Over Military Camp in Herat to ANDSF | TOLOnews,"After two decades of deployment, Italian forces on Wednesday handed over control of a military camp in Herat to Afghan forces.
Afghan military officials said Italian forces have pulled out their military equipment as well as destroyed some. 
In recent weeks, loud explosions have been heard from the camp and military officials said the Italian forces destroyed large numbers of armored vehicles and heavy weapons before evacuating.
“In terms of military equipment, nothing was left for us from the Italians,” said Major General Sayed Emal Pacha, the commander of an Afghan air force division.
“We pledge that our security and defense forces across Afghanistan are ready to defend our country and the people in the western zone and in Herat,” said Abdul Saboor Qane, governor of Herat.
“All aviation services are being carried out by the professional cadres of Khawja Abdullah Ansari airport. There have been no problems at all at the airport following the withdrawal of foreign forces and flights are being carried out normally and regularly,” said Abdul Shaheer Salehi, the director of Herat airport.
With the withdrawal of Italian forces from Herat, the control of Herat’s airport was also handed over to the Afghan government.
Meanwhile, Germany also completed the withdrawal of its forces from Afghanistan.
Germany’s last troops left Afghanistan on Tuesday after nearly 20 years of deployment in the country, said German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. 
The German defense minister said in a tweet that the last Bundeswehr soldiers “left Afghanistan safely” on Tuesday evening.   
She thanked the more than 150,000 troops who have served there since 2001 and said that “they can be proud of this mission.”

182,Baghlan Residents: Taliban Using Homes as Fighting Positions | TOLOnews,"Residents in Pul-e-Khumri city, the center of the Afghan northern province of Baghlan, on Wednesday said that the Taliban are using people’s homes as fighting positions as they battle Afghan forces. 
A family who lost a member during the fighting has called on the warring parties to avoid using the people’s homes. 
The Taliban has denied it is doing so. 
“Both sides chant the slogan of Allah Akbar (God is great), both sides claim to be the martyrs, the innocent people are also martyred,” said Rassoul Khan, brother of the victim.
“It is not only the father who is faced with this tragedy, the entire village is suffering from it,” said Abdullah, a resident of Pul-e-Khumri.
“My mother was wounded,” said a child in Pul-e-Khumri.
“When I leave home for the office, many things come into my mind, I feel that there will be war there,” said Frozan Sadat, a media worker in Pul-e-Khumri.
Baghlan has been one of the major battleground areas between the Afghan security forces and the Taliban in the past two months.
Health officials in Baghlan on Tuesday said that over 100 civilians were killed and wounded--among them women and children--in recent clashes between the Afghan security forces and the Taliban in the province.
Afghan security officials in Baghlan said that the Taliban once again tried to penetrate the defenses of Pul-e-Khumri city on Monday night, however, security forces managed to repel the attacks.
“We hit them. Their corpses are still lying behind those walls. They have not transferred their dead bodies so far,” said Raz Mohammad, an Afghan commando officer in Baghlan, referring to the battles with the Taliban.

184,AP: Most European Troops Leaving Afghanistan Quietly | TOLOnews,"Most of the European troops have already pulled out of Afghanistan, quietly withdrawing months before the US-led mission was officially expected to end, AP reported. 
On Wednesday, Germany and Italy declared their missions in Afghanistan over and Poland’s last troops returned home, bringing their deployments to a low-key end nearly 20 years after the first Western soldiers were deployed there. 
Announcements from several countries analyzed by the AP show that a majority of European troops has now left with little ceremony — a stark contrast to the dramatic and public show of force and unity when NATO allies lined up to back the US invasion to rid the country of al-Qaida after the Sept. 11,  2001, attacks. 
In April, US President Joe Biden announced that the US troops would leave Afghanistan by September 11.  
In the ensuing decades, the war went from one mission to another. Former US President George W. Bush’s administration shied away from nation-building and the United Nations advocated a light footprint. But with the passing years, NATO and US troops took on greater roles developing Afghanistan’s National Security and Defense Forces and training police. At the war’s peak, the US and NATO military numbers surpassed 150,000. 
NATO agreed in April to withdraw its roughly 7,000 non-American forces from Afghanistan to match Biden’s decision to pull all American troops from the country, starting May 1. 
The US has refused to give troop figures, but when Biden announced the final pullout, between 2,500 and 3,500 troops were deployed. As of February, a total of some 832,000 American troops had served in Afghanistan, while about 25,100 Defense Department civilians had also served there. 
The US has also refused to give a clear date for a final withdrawal. 
On Tuesday, the US Defense Department called on the Taliban to return to the peace negotiations, reminding them that the violence remains too high in Afghanistan.  
“What we want to see, what we'd like to see is the Taliban return to the peace process in a credible way,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said at a press briefing on Tuesday. “The violence remains too high, and we’re all aware of all of the security situation in Afghanistan.”  
“I think you saw General Miller speak to that earlier today, concerns over the security situation there,” he added.   
Referring to recent attacks by the Taliban, Kirby said, “We see events on the ground unfold, it certainly calls into question the sincerity of their efforts to be a legitimate, credible participant in the peace process.”   
“That's really the right future for Afghanistan as a political process that leads to a negotiated settlement and a peaceful end to the fighting in Afghanistan. And that's what we're in favor of. That's what the administration's policy continues to try to pursue,” Kirby said.   
Abdullah Abdullah, chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation (HCNR), at the council’s leadership committee meeting at the Presidential Palace on Wednesday said that “the survival of Afghanistan is in danger.”  
The sixth leadership committee meeting of the HCNR was held at the Presidential Palace and was attended by President Ashraf Ghani, HCNR members and other government officials.  
“The truth is, today the survival, security and unity of Afghanistan is in danger.” Abdullah said. “There is no better way than peace.”  
“With the withdrawal of foreign troops from the country, the war has escalated. Unfortunately, the Taliban side has taken advantage of this, and the foreign troop withdrawal has naturally left a vacuum in some areas,” said Abdullah.  
“Although teams from both sides are in Doha and in contact, we have not witnessed any progress,"" Abdullah said. “They (the Taliban) take very slow steps in the peace talks but have increased the war on the battlefield.”  
“Unfortunately, the Taliban wasted time in the peace process over the months, and there was concern among the people that the Taliban had no intention or will to seek peace. This concern is now growing day by day,” he said.  
“The truth we are facing is the escalation of the war. In today’s meeting, I cannot see anyone that says we must continue the war and the way out is war.”

TOLOnews' reporter Amiry said that for the ""first time in the past 10 days several parts of the center of Pul-e-Khumri are calm and have not witnessed clashes.” 
Eight districts in Baghlan have fallen to the Taliban in the fighting over the last three weeks. Security forces have retaken two of the districts: Doshi and Khinjan. 
On Sunday, the government reported that 8,000 families were displaced in Baghlan in the last three weeks, leaving many of them stranded on the streets of Pul-e-Khumri while others live in close quarters with dozens per single home.

Hibatullah Alizai, the commander of the Special Operations Corps, said that suppressing the Taliban is the top priority of the forces and that ""strong belts"" have been created for the protection of big cities, highways and border towns.
Alizai said there was a vast presence of Pakistani Taliban, especially Punjabis, in recent attacks by the Taliban, and that “hundreds” of Taliban fighters have been killed in Afghan forces operations.
He stressed the need to retake the districts that have fallen to the Taliban.
He said that political, regional and social issues are behind the evacuation of dozens of districts by Afghan forces. He added that the issue will be investigated.
The general said that the Taliban wants to attack major cities but the Afghan forces are ready to thwart such plans.
“Our main goal is to inflict as many casualties on the enemy as possible. Besides that, our goal is to protect major cities, highways and key border towns that are important for our major cities and the country,” he said.
Alizai, who returned from operations in Ghazni and Laghman on Saturday evening, said that foreign Taliban and al Qaeda fighters have a presence among the Taliban.
“Pakistani Taliban are mostly seen these days and those Taliban who belong to Punjab and those who even have Pakistan arm ID cards. The number of Afghan Taliban is dwindling,” he said.
He added that at least 10,000 members of commando forces are engaged in suppressing the Taliban across the country and that their number will increase over time.
However, there is criticism over how security in the country has been handled:
“If they had paid attention to the provinces, we would not be in the situation that we are today,” said Daud Ghafoori, a Senator.
In the last two months, at least 120 districts have fallen to the Taliban, mostly in northern and northeastern Afghanistan.

He said that the closure of border towns, supply routes and attacks on major cities and districts are among the goals of the Taliban, but he assured the people that such attempts will be repelled.
Talking to TOLOnews in an exclusive interview, Gen. Ahmadzai reiterated that efforts will be made to mobilize the Afghan military to retake areas fallen to the Taliban.
“There is no respect for anything ... the enemy is trying to conduct a trade war against us, create economic issues.

Meanwhile, an army commander said Pakistani Taliban are fighting the Afghan forces among the Taliban ranks. He said that at least 120 Taliban fighters are killed in attacks against Afghan forces on a daily basis.
“The Taliban cannot resist against us. If they bring 1,000 of them, 1,000 will die, if they come with 2,000,  they will die, and if one of them comes, that one will die, but this homeland will always shine, this flag will always fly,” the Maiwand Corps Commander Gen. Sami Sadat said.

216,Taliban Have ‘Every Reason’ to Return to Talks: UK Military Chief | TOLOnews,"The UK Chief of the Defense Staff General Sir Nick Carter said in an interview with the BBC that the Taliban have got every reason to return to the talks and that a majority of the people in Afghanistan do not want the group to govern, while reiterating a call for unity among political leaders in the country.
Talking to the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show, Carter said, “The Taliban have got every reason to come to the table because 60% of Afghanistan are other ethnicities than Pashtuns and they don’t want the Taliban there so there has got to be a negotiated settlement ultimately if the country is going to be governed as a whole country.”
“The key political players in Kabul at the moment have got to show unity because if they show unity, and if the government continues to hold on to the provincial capitals and particularly Kabul as I described then that’s going to bring the Taliban to the table,” he added.
He said that it is too early to say what will happen once the withdrawal of foreign forces are completed. However, he added that there are three scenarios at the moment: “The current government couldn’t fight on as it’s doing at the moment without support from NATO troops… Secondly, there is a risk that the state could fracture and you could end up with different ethnicities breaking the country up as they did in the 1990s… And the third more helpful scenario is that you are going to press for compromise and of course the longer the Afghan government retains the provincial capitals that it is still retaining, the more likely that scenario is to play out.”
He commended the Afghan government’s current strategy to keep provincial centers.
“What I would say is that the Afghan government is pursuing a very sensible strategy of consolidation. At the moment they are not going to fight for every rural area because they don’t need to; what they need to do is to retain provincial capitals… And therefore, control the majority of the population who are now increasingly urbanized.”
He said the challenge faced by the Taliban is: “Can they govern as much of those rural areas as they have now got?”
He said that the Taliban’s credibility could be easily undermined if they are unable to govern these territories.

It is not known who will represent the Taliban in the talks. 
 
This comes as Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the High Council for National Reconciliation, and former president Hamid Karzai, on Tuesday said they expect important steps to be taken in the peace talks within the next few days. 
 
Karzai said that meaningful peace talks are expected to resume soon, but he reiterated that the Afghan government and the Taliban should not lose the current opportunity for reconciliation. 
 
“You will soon witness the resumption of meaningful peace negotiations,” Karzai said at a press conference, calling on the people to not lose hope and to remain in the country. “Have patience, have plans, and move toward peace.” 
 
The former president said the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan has deep roots in world powers' interference for the last two centuries. 
 
Violence and clashes continue in over 20 provinces of the country, but the two sides have not stopped the efforts for peace. US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad is in the region and has met with negotiators in Doha in the last two days.  
 
“Mr. Khalilzad’s trip is important because the US forces are withdrawing from Afghanistan and, therefore, efforts are being made to help Afghan sides achieve peace,” university lecturer Faiz Mohammad Zaland said.

Armed with light and heavy weapons, the forces warn the Taliban that they will be killed if they get closer to the city of Herat.
Mohammad Ismail Khan says the Resistance Front forces are coordinating their activities with security agencies.
“The government is busy with ensuring security and peace to protect people and the country. To prevent any clash between security forces and the People Resistance Front forces, and to be able to jointly defend the city of Herat, we mutually coordinate things,” said Mohammad Ismail Khan, the leader of the People's Resistance Front.
Sayed Ahmad, a member of the People's Resistance Front, said: “Until the last drop of blood, we are going to defend our country, our people, and our city with high morale.”
Abdul Shakur, another member of the People's Resistance Front, said: “Under no circumstances will we allow the Taliban to enter Herat city. We assure our people that they can continue their normal life.”
The role of the public forces in ensuring security and preventing the Taliban from advancing in Herat is considered vital by the Afghan government and residents of the province.
“After the formation of the people’s mobilization against the Taliban, there has been partial security in Herat city. Compared to last week, the security situation is better now and people’s life has come back to normal,” said Maroof Herawi, a resident of Herat province.
“We need people’s help, cooperation, and support to ensure a lasting security,” said Eraj Faqiri, a resident of Herat.
Hassan Majrooh, who is a military analyst, said: “If the people's mobilization would have a regular and systematic organization and management, and perform activities based on regular leadership and orders--and would not be under any personal orders--it can be very effective in defending the country and the people.”
Meanwhile, security officials in Badghis say Taliban attacks on Qala-e-Naw city have diminished, and security forces have reduced Taliban threats by establishing a security belt around the city.
“The Taliban once again launched multiple attacks on the temporary checkpoints on one of the security belts around the city of Herat, but security forces pushed back these attacks. The Taliban feared lots of casualties,” said Shir Aqa Alokozai, the police chief of Badghis district.
As the Taliban has taken large swathes of territory in the western part of the country, hundreds of residents of Herat province have been mobilized against the Taliban fighters.

222,UN Agency Warns of Humanitarian Crisis in Afghanistan | TOLOnews,"The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has warned over a looming humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan due to ongoing violence in the country. 
An estimated 270,000 Afghans have been newly displaced inside the country since January 2021 – primarily due to insecurity and violence –  bringing the total uprooted population to over 3.5 million. 
UNHCR reported that the families forced to flee their homes in recent weeks cite the worsening security situation as the predominant reason for their flight.
In addition to ongoing fighting, displaced civilians have told UNHCR and partners of incidents of extortion by non-state armed groups and the presence of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) on major roads.  
Many have reported interruptions to social services and a loss of income due to rising insecurity. 
The number of civilian casualties has risen 29 percent during the first quarter of this year compared to 2020, according to UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, UNHCR says. An increasing proportion of women and children were among those targeted.   
The needs of those who have had to flee suddenly are acute. UNHCR and partners, as part of a coordinated response, are assisting newly displaced Afghans with emergency shelter, food, health, water and sanitation support and cash assistance, despite challenges in accessing vulnerable groups. 
UNHCR says that the resilience of the Afghan people has been pushed to the limit by prolonged conflict, high levels of displacement, the impact of COVID-19, recurrent natural disasters, including drought, and deepening poverty. Some 65 per cent of the Afghan population – in and outside of Afghanistan – are children and young people. 
A failure to reach a peace agreement in Afghanistan and stem the current violence will lead to further displacement within the country, as well as to neighbouring countries and beyond, the UN organization says.
Iran and Pakistan host nearly 90 percent of displaced Afghans - more than two million registered Afghan refugees in total, according to the UNHCR.
Both countries have granted access to territory and protection to Afghan refugees, along with health and educational services through national systems. Their hospitality and inclusive policies, spanning decades and generations, must not be taken for granted, it says.
UNHCR urges the international community to step up support to the Afghan government and people of Afghanistan and its neighbours at this critical moment, in a spirit of solidarity and burden-sharing. 
UNHCR’s financial appeal for the Afghanistan situation (including operations for Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran) remains acutely underfunded, at only 43 percent of a total US$ 337 million required. 
This comes as the Afghan government and the United Nations have assessed that Afghanistan needs $953 million for humanitarian assistance and $200 million to $250 million for development programs.
The assessment, called “Joint Humanitarian Appeal,” says that over 18 million people in Afghanistan are in need of humanitarian assistance due to conflicts, coronavirus and drought.

The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said:
“The reports of killing, ill-treatment, persecution and discrimination are widespread and disturbing, creating fear and insecurity,” it said, adding that “those who carry out any such acts must be held accountable.” 
The statement specifically mentioned the reported harm to women and girls:

The statement also referenced the protection of infrastructure, as Taliban fighters have been destroying government buildings in their attacks on district centers in the country.

227,"Taliban Destroyed, Damaged Infrastructure in 116 Districts: IARCS | TOLOnews","Ahmad Nader Nadery, the chairman of the Independent Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission (IARCSC), on Thursday said that the IARCSC findings show that in the districts recently seized by the Taliban essential government services have been halted, and a large number of civil servants have been harmed, or displaced from their areas to provincial capitals.
According to Nadery, the Taliban either torched or destroyed 260 government buildings and assets in 116 districts.
Nadery said that 13 million Afghans have been deprived of social services in the Taliban-controlled areas and 50,000 employees including women have been affected in Taliban territories.
“There are more than 13 million people living in areas and districts recently captured by the Taliban, who currently have no access to public services. In these areas, hundreds of development projects such as the reconstruction of water supply networks, roads, retaining walls, the construction of schools, bridges, hospitals, stadiums, cold storage facilities, drilling wells, etc., have been shut down. For instance, in the Taliban-controlled districts of Takhar province alone, 112 ongoing development projects have now been completely stopped,” said IARCSC chief Nader Nadery.
The Taliban has denied the allegations.
Nadery said that the damage done by the Taliban on state institutions is estimated to be around $500 million. He said that 4,000 public services employees have evacuated their native areas because of the threats of the Taliban.
“Attacks on civilian targets, including civilian infrastructure, is a clear breach of international humanitarian laws. These crimes must stop. A peaceful settlement of conflict and a shared future for our people is the only path to stop the destruction and suffering of our country and people,” said Nadery.
“In districts under Taliban control in Paktia province, only those women working in gynecology are permitted to work, but they must wear a Hijab and be accompanied by a Mahram,” said Nadery.
“As the Taliban took control of the districts, more than 50,000 civil servants are unable to perform their duties and live in an uncertain situation. Nearly 4,000 of which have either been harmed or displaced from their areas to provincial capitals due to the bad security situation and threats,” said Nadery.
Meanwhile, the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) has said that there are reports that the Taliban imposed some restrictions on the people in areas under their control over the past few weeks.
According to the AIHRC, these restrictions included a ban on women leaving the house without a proper veil and male guardian, the closure of girls schools, a ban on the delivery of health services to women who do not have male guardians, a halt to TV programs, forcing teachers and students to not shave their beards, and putting on turbans.
“Thirteen million humans, 13 million oppressed people in Afghanistan have been affected due to the actions of the Taliban,” said Nadery.
“One of the restrictions is a restriction on women, one of the restrictions is that the women cannot go out of their homes without a veil and guardian,” said Zabihullah Farhang, a spokesman for the AIHRC.
“From the day the Taliban took over our area, the women cannot go outside of their homes or to work,” said senator Fawzia Samkani.
However, the Taliban in a statement has rejected Naderi’s statement.
The Taliban in their statement said that social services including the delivery of health services, agriculture and schooling continues in their areas.

229,Ghani at Int’l Summit Blasts Pakistan for ‘Supporting’ Taliban | TOLOnews,"President Ashraf Ghani at an international summit in Uzbekistan on Friday criticized Pakistan for what he called support to the Taliban, calling on the neighboring country to use its influence and leverage for peace and cessation of hostilities in Afghanistan.
“Intelligence estimates indicate the influx of over 10,000 jihadi fighters from Pakistan and other places in the last month, as well as, support from their affiliates and the transnational terrorist organizations,” President Ghani said at the summit named “Central and South Asia: Regional Connectivity, Challenges and Opportunities.”
“Contrary to the repeated assurances by Prime Minister Khan and his generals that Pakistan does not find a Taliban take over in Afghanistan in Pakistan’s interest, and assured of its use of force will use its power to influence to make the Taliban negotiate seriously, networks and organizations supporting the Taliban are openly celebrating the destruction of assets and capabilities of the Afghan people and state,” he said.
President Ghani said that there is a consensus among credible international observers that the Taliban has not taken any steps to sever their relationship with terrorist organizations. 
“Contrary to the declarations of their political office that they will not attack cities and provincial centers they are accelerating their attacks and attempting to starve the cities,” Ghani said, referring to recent attacks by Taliban.
“We are prepared to face the Taliban and their supporters for as long as it takes until they realize that a political solution is the only way forward,” he said. “We, therefore, call on the Taliban to engage with the government of Afghanistan to end the war and the destructive recent onslaught.”
Ghani asked the region for “sense of urgency,” adding, “Lessons learnt are clear. Without regional consensus, and support peace does not break out.”
“To plunge Afghanistan into all-out war is to plunge the region into radical uncertainty. Pakistan, therefore, needs to be engaged coherently and urgently from the perspective of regional interest,” he concluded.
On the sidelines of this conference, President Ghani met with Uzbek president, a US delegation and the Pakistani prime minister.

He said that losing territory during the war is a natural phenomenon, but territory never determines the fate of the conflict.
“The Taliban will not reach to their goals through violence. They only add to the pain and suffering of our people. But they will not reach to their evil goal. We are fully committed to defend Afghanistan,” said Mohammadi.
Mohammadi made the remarks during the graduation ceremony of 135 Afghan Special Force members in Kabul. The new officers will soon be deployed to the frontlines.
“We will not allow anyone to rule our country and soil until we are alive,” said a newly Special Force graduate Sayed Tawala.
“The Afghan people must be assured,” said Sakina, a Special Force officer.
The graduation comes at a time that the Taliban have taken over 200 districts in the past two months.

“We will defend till last drop our blood and will not permit the enemy to get to its evil objective,” said Khaled Amiri, the commander of Special Forces of the Afghan National Army (ANA).
Violence dramatically increased in Afghanistan following the US announcement of withdrawing its forces from the country by August 31st.

The statement was issued by the following missions: Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, the EU delegation, Finland, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States. 
“We condemn the continued targeted killings taking place throughout Afghanistan, the destruction of vital infrastructure, and threats, declarations, and other actions against the gains Afghans have made over the last twenty years, gains which we have strongly supported,” it said.  
The statement from the missions also said that the Taliban’s offensive is in direct contradiction to their claim to support a negotiated settlement to the conflict and to the Doha peace process. 
“It has resulted in loss of innocent Afghan lives, including through continued targeted killings, displacement of the civilian’s population, looting and burning of buildings, destruction of vital infrastructure, and damage to communication networks,” the statement said. 
“The indiscriminate detaining and killings of civilians and assaults of prisons demonstrates an extremely concerning disregard for the rule of law. In districts occupied by the Taliban, inhabitants and observers also credibly report attempts to repress the human rights of women and girls and to shut down private and public media organizations in an attempt to conceal their human rights abuses and diminish freedom of expression,” it states.
“On behalf of our respective missions, we vehemently condemn these and any other actions that violate the human rights of Afghan citizens. Afghans have made numerous gains over the past 20 years and want to continue building on their achievements in development, human rights, and free speech,” it noted. 
“We want to underscore that progress made over the past years can only be sustained if all parties work together,” it said. 
“We join the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan in calling on the Taliban and all parties to immediately end violence, agree to a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire, and engage fully in peace negotiations to end the suffering of the Afghan people and pave the way to an inclusive political settlement that benefits all Afghans and ensures that Afghanistan does not again serve as a safe haven for insurgents,” it added.

Ghani said the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan’s decision to send a high-ranking delegation to Doha for negotiations was an ultimatum.
“Taliban made clear many things. Mr. Abdullah told me some minutes ago that there is no will for peace in Taliban. We sent the delegation to do the ultimatum and to show that we have the will for peace and we are ready for sacrifice for it, but they (Taliban) have no will for peace and we should make decisions based on this,” Ghani said.
Ghani said this Eid has been named after Afghan forces to honor their sacrifices and courage, especially in the last three months.
“Afghanistan’s security and defense forces have made many sacrifices in the last 20 years, especially in the last three months, to defend this soil and honor of this homeland, sincerely,” Ghani said.
He added that he has spent the last week working on an “urgent and practical plan” to overcome the current situation. President Ghani says Afghans should prove in action that they are united.
“This plan has been prepared. It has two parts in terms of security,” he said. He added that one part of the plan is setting priorities for security and defense forces.
He said a firm stance by the people for the next three to six months will change the situation.
Ghani reiterated that there is a need for national support and national defense and said the future of Afghanistan will be made in Afghanistan and by Afghans.
He said today’s Afghanistan is not the one it was 20 years ago and every city has signs of development.
“There is no place for forming militias and arbitrariness in this country,” he said.
He said the Taliban “destroyed 260 public buildings” and that if they are Afghans they should avoid eliminating public establishments and people’s houses.
Ghani said the government released 5,000 Taliban prisoners but the group so far has not been ready for meaningful talks.

But Noor said this will not happen and the government will not repeat its previous act--of releasing 5,000 inmates--which did not help in reducing violence or furthering the peace process in the country. 
He added that three commissions were formed during the two days of talks in Doha – the commission for building trust, commission on review of the Constitution and the commission for partnership in power – but none led to any results. 
Noor said that trust can be built through other ways. 
“Trust can be built through understanding, partnership in power, political partnership, end of war, reduction in violence, and ceasefire. We could have started from any other route, but regretfully, this did not happen,” Noor said. 
He welcomed the agreement in Doha for the continuation of negotiations and the protection of civilians and their property but said that there are other ways that trust can be built between both sides. 
“We hope that one day the other side will realize that war is not the solution in Afghanistan and peace is in the interest of all sides,” he said.

Ghani said the Taliban want the surrender of the government, and he reiterated that there won’t be any deal on women’s rights.

This follows a relative calm across the country during the first and second days of Eid.
“A joint attack was carried out against the Taliban positions. These brave men managed to swiftly recapture this district from the Taliban,” said Jailani Farhad, a spokesman to Herat governor.
Sources said Taliban captured Ghazi Abad district in Kunar province.
The Defense Ministry said that government forces inflicted heavy casualties to the Taliban in at least 10 provinces across the country in the past 24 hours and killed over 150 Taliban fighters. Taliban has rejected the claims.
While Taliban is still trying to capture more swaths of land in the country, the Afghan security institutions have said that the ANDSF as part of the new security plan is trying to retake the country’s financial ports and other strategic locations from the militant group. The Afghan government recently said it will soon unveil a three to six months security plan based on which the ANDSF will be able to change the current situation.
Kunar is one of the provinces in the eastern parts of the county that saw some of the fiercest battles over the past few weeks. But Afghan officials have said that several villages have been cleared of the Taliban in the area.
“The government forces conquered areas in Chilamazar, Qaria-e-Mullah Ishaq and areas around Tapa-e-Taimoor, the enemies left these areas,” Kunduz police chief Zubair Safai said.
Nevertheless, President Ashraf Ghani has said that based on the new plan, the current security situation will change once the new security strategy is practically put in place.
Based on the new plan, the ANDSF will beef up security measures for major cities, airports, highways, strategic locations and ports.
“You resist for three months. In six months time, you will reach your desirable peace. Today the Taliban haae no will for peace,” Ghani said on Thursday.
“You can see that the public mindset is totally against the Taliban. No city in Afghanistan will collapse. All the strategic distircts and important border towns will be retaken,” the deputy minister of interior for policy and strategy, Naqibullah Fayeq, said.
There are also reports that at least 10 civilians have been killed in various provinces in the past 24 hours as a result of rewned violence.
Since the official announcement of the US forces' withdrawal, 215 districts, including several economically-important port areas, are under Taliban influence.

250,Envoys Seek End to Taliban’s ‘Military Offensive’ | TOLOnews,"The special representatives from the United States, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, NATO, Norway, and the United Kingdom met in Rome on 22 July to discuss the situation in Afghanistan and the developments in the Afghan peace negotiations after the latest round of high-level talks in Doha last week, reiterating on an immediate end to violence in the country.
The envoys in a statement said they are committed to a strong partnership with Afghanistan and will be closely monitoring ongoing developments in this new phase of transition with the withdrawal of international forces.
They said that the people of Afghanistan have suffered for too long from conflict and that they are deeply concerned about the high levels of violence, the Taliban’s military offensive, and the number of reported serious human rights abuses and violations alleged in communities most affected by the ongoing armed conflict across the country.
“We call on all parties to reduce violence and protect civilians, respecting their obligations under international humanitarian law. We call on the Taliban to end their military offensive, and on both the Islamic Republic and the Taliban to engage meaningfully in the peace process. We reiterate the urgency of reaching a ceasefire to ensure the success of negotiations, and we acknowledge the sacrifices of the Afghan security forces,” the envoys said in the statement. 
The envoys said there is no military solution to the conflict in Afghanistan and that they stand by UNSC resolution 2513 (2020), and they do not support any government in Afghanistan imposed through military force.
“We express our full support to an inclusive Afghan-owned and Afghan-led peace process with full and meaningful participation of women that leads to a just and durable political settlement,” the envoys said. 
“We also highlight five elements of a final settlement that are most critical: (1) inclusive governance; (2) the right to elect political leaders; (3) protections for human rights, including rights of women, youth and minorities; (4) commitments on counter-terrorism, including to ensure that Afghanistan does not again serve as a safe haven for terrorists; and (5) adherence to international law, including international humanitarian law. We emphasize that international support to any future government will depend, at least in part, on adherence to these five elements,” they said in the statement. 
The special representatives said they intend to maintain their support for Afghan institutions, including defense and security forces, to address the country’s urgent needs. 
“We also reiterate that future assistance to Afghanistan is dependent on good governance and a commitment to the rule of law and human rights, including preservation of the gains made by women and girls over the past two decades, as well as the government taking meaningful steps to tackle corruption and to meeting commitments made at the November 2020 Geneva Conference,” the envoys said.
The envoys welcomed the talks held in Doha on July 17 and 18 between senior leaders of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban. 
“We further welcome the declared commitment of the two sides to accelerate negotiations toward an inclusive political settlement and to meet again in the near future. We believe future meetings should focus on core issues that will be fundamental to reaching an inclusive political settlement,” they said.
The envoys said they acknowledged that reaching a final political settlement, including on the Constitution, will likely take time. “We urge the two sides to agree on a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire and on foundational principles for the future Afghan State and details of transitional governing arrangements until a final political settlement is reached. We emphasize that any transitional governing arrangements must be inclusive, respect the rights of all Afghans in line with Afghanistan’s international commitments and also uphold counter-terrorism commitments,” they added.
The envoys said they welcome in particular the commitments made by the Taliban yesterday to inclusive governance, respecting human rights including the rights of women and minorities, to abide by international law, including international humanitarian law, and upholding counter-terrorism commitments. They said that they also welcome the Taliban’s openness to negotiate a mechanism for representative government with the Islamic Republic negotiation team.
“We call on the two parties to negotiate in good faith in order to reach a just and durable political settlement. To promote progress in the negotiations, we support any third-party facilitation or mediation welcomed by the two sides,” the special representatives said.
The envoys asked the Taliban and the Islamic Republic to deliver on their commitments (1) to prevent the use of Afghan soil by al Qaeda, Da’esh or other terrorist groups from launching attacks against, or threatening the security of, any other country; and (2) not to host members of these groups nor to allow them to recruit, train, fundraise or transit through Afghanistan.
“We urge the Taliban to reduce violence, uphold their commitments to protect Afghanistan’s infrastructure, protect civilians and cooperate on humanitarian assistance, particularly as the Afghan people suffer acutely from the effects of COVID-19 and drought, in addition to violence. We call on the Taliban to allow and facilitate, without preconditions and consistent with international humanitarian law, access for delivery of humanitarian aid, to areas under their control,” they said.
The envoys said that they believe that Afghanistan can contribute to regional and international stability and connectivity. They asked Afghanistan’s neighbors to intensify their support to the Afghan people and to contribute to a lasting peace settlement and economic development in the interests of all.
“We also call upon all parties to ensure the safety of foreign embassies and other diplomatic missions, multilateral agencies, media representatives, airports and non-governmental organizations and their Afghan and international staff. We particularly appreciate Turkey’s readiness and commitment to assist with airport security as needed,” the envoys said.

The US also has called on the Taliban “to engage in serious negotiations” after the group’s insistence that they will not agree on ceasefire and peace unless there is an agreement on a new government in Afghanistan. 
“We call on the Taliban to engage in serious negotiations to determine a political roadmap for Afghanistan's future that leads to a just and durable settlement,” US State Department’s deputy spokesperson Jalina Porter said. 
“A negotiated settlement between the Islamic Republic and the Taliban is the only way to end 40 years of war and bring Afghans to peace that they seek and deserve,” she added.

Russia on Friday pledged to help its ally Tajikistan to build a new outpost on the border.
The two countries will also hold major drills next month.
""The parties discussed the situation in the Tajik-Afghan border area and joint measures to neutralise threats related to the escalating situation in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan,"" Russian foreign ministry said as quoted vy TASS.
Russia operates a military base in Tajikistan, a former Soviet republic, whose government has expressed concern about the rapidly deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan.
Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, another Central Asian republic bordering Afghanistan, will hold joint military drills close to the Tajikistan and Afghanistan border next month, according to Reuters report.
Russia has sent military equipment to border areas between Tajikistan and Afghanistan to prevent possible threats originating from the country.
Tajikistan’s President Emomali Rahmon while addressing the Tajik army during a military exercise last week said that the situation in Afghanistan remains fragile, adding that his country is fully prepared to face the possible threats from Afghanistan.

261,Civilian Casualties in Afghanistan Hit Record Levels: UN | TOLOnews,"Resulting from a spike in violence in May that corresponded with the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan, the civilian casualties reported in the country for the first half of 2021 have reached record levels, the UN said in a report released on Monday. 
The UN has warned that without significant de-escalation, 2021 will witness the highest ever number of documented civilian casualties in a single year since UNAMA recording began.  
The UN report said that 1,659 civilians were killed and 3,254 others were wounded, which is a 47 percent increase compared to the same period in 2020.  
Of serious concern is the acute rise in the number of civilians killed and injured in the period from May 1, with almost as many civilian casualties in the May-June period as recorded in the entire preceding four months, according to the report. 
The number of civilian casualties during May and June –783 killed and 1,609 wounded--is the highest for those months since UNAMA began its systematic documentation in 2009.  
The period January-April 2021 saw 2,791 civilian casualties (876 killed and 1,915 injured), said the UN. 
“I implore the Taliban and Afghan leaders to take heed of the conflict's grim and chilling trajectory and its devastating impact on civilians. The report provides a clear warning that unprecedented numbers of Afghan civilians will perish and be maimed this year if the increasing violence is not stemmed,"" said Deborah Lyons, the Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Afghanistan.  
The UN envoy, who is also the head of UNAMA, called on the Taliban and Afghan leaders to ""intensify your efforts at the negotiating table, stop the Afghan against Afghan fighting"" and to ""protect the Afghan people and give them hope for a better future.”  
“The pursuit of a military solution will only increase the suffering of the Afghan people,” the report said. 
The UN urged the parties to follow their obligations under international law to protect civilians. 
The report noted that what is“particularly shocking” and of ""deep concern"" is that women, boys and girls made up ""close to half of all civilian casualties in the first half of 2021,"" it said. 
“Comprising 46 percent of all civilian casualties, 32 percent were children – 1,682 in total (468 killed and 1,214 injured) and 14 percent were women – 727 in total (219 killed and 508 injured),” the report said, adding: “It is sickening to report that more women and more children were killed and wounded than ever before recorded by UNAMA for the first half of any calendar year.” 
""Anti-Government Elements (AGEs) were responsible for 64 percent of the total civilian casualties: 39 percent by Taliban, nearly nine percent by Daesh and 16 percent by undetermined AGEs,"" the report said. 
""Pro-Government Forces (PGFs) were responsible for 25 percent of civilian casualties: 23 percent by Afghan national security forces, and two percent by pro-Government armed groups or undetermined PGFs,"" according to the report. 
UNAMA attributed 11 percent of all civilian casualties to ""crossfire"" during ground engagements where the exact party responsible could not be determined and other incident types, including unattributable unexploded ordnance/explosive remnants of war.  
UNAMA is also concerned about the ""increasing number of reports of killing, ill-treatment, persecution and discrimination in communities affected by the current fighting and its aftermath,"" the report said, adding that it is ""particularly important, especially during times of heightened conflict, that all parties respect the human rights and dignity of people and prevent such abuses and violations.""

267,UN Envoy Warns Taliban of Intl Isolation If No Movement in Talks | TOLOnews,"Addressing the Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board (JCMB) meeting at the Presidential Palace on Wednesday, Deborah Lyons, the UN secretary general's special representative for Afghanistan, said that if there is no progress in the peace talks the world will not work with the Taliban. 
 ""If there is no movement at the negotiating table, and instead human rights abuses and worse still atrocities occur in districts they control, the Taliban will not be seen as a viable partner for the international community,"" said Lyons.  
Lyons said that the meeting takes place in extraordinary circumstances, with work to preserve the gains never more urgent or challenging.  
""With the territory they have taken the Taliban have inherited responsibilities. The world is watching closely how they are acting, especially towards civilian populations, women, and minorities. The Taliban have gained a certain legitimacy in recent years through their negotiations in Doha, but this legitimacy is premised on their commitment to a political negotiation with the Government of Afghanistan, a commitment which their battle-focused strategy casts into doubt,"" said Lyons. 

""No major donor will finance the repression of women, let me say that again, no major donor will finance the repression of women, nor any major donor will finance the discrimination of minorities, the denying of education to girls, or the decrees of an authoritarian government,"" said Lyons, adding: ""They cannot do so, not only because these are against the norms of the United Nations and international community, but because a society built on these restrictions cannot and will not function for its citizens.""
The UN envoy addressed the other challenges facing Afghanistan:
""Eighteen million Afghans today are facing dire humanitarian needs. That is twice the number of the same category last year. It represents half the country. As we sit in this room today, we must have foremost on our minds these 18 million Afghans, who in the height of a hot summer, endure a fourth wave of COVID (like so many other countries around the world) endure a persistent drought, and intensified fighting that has killed among the highest number Afghans ever —as reported in our recent UNAMA Mid-term review on Protection of Civilians."" 
She also said that: “donors seek reassurance from Afghanistan government that it recognizes the nature of the current crisis and that it has a strategic outlook that addresses it.” 
In the meantime, Afghan President Ghani at the meeting also said: “We believe in the future of Afghanistan,” adding that “today’s Afghanistan has really changed.”  
“I offered a bridge to peace through the holding of early elections,” President Ghani said. “The Loya Jirga took the unprecedented step of releasing 5,000 hardened Taliban fighters and some of the largest drug dealers under the assurance of good conduct by the international community.” 
“Today’s war is not a civil war,” Ghani said, adding that “it’s the war of the networks.”  
“I assure the international community that the people of Afghanistan don’t want anti-government elements,” Ghani said. 
Religious scholars from various countries, including Pakistan, have said that the “current war in Afghanistan is not a religious war,” he added.   
Ghani stated: “There is no military solution to the country’s issue,"" adding that the Afghan government believes in a political settlement. 
“The only solution for the Taliban is a political agreement that satisfies all the people,” he mentioned. 
Referring to the announcement to withdraw foreign troops from Afghanistan by September 11, President Ghani said: “We respect the US President Biden and NATO’s decision on troops withdrawal.” 
“We have never asked President Joe Biden and NATO to change their decision over their troop’s withdrawal from Afghanistan,"" he said, adding that “Afghans should make their future on their own.” 
“The departure of the international forces gives us the opportunity to frame and implement our sovereignty strategies in the manner suited to our unique conditions and history as well as the benefits of regional connectivity and global cooperation,” he added. 
“We have cut the national budget by 5.2% to eliminate waste, prioritize the use of condition-based assistance, ensure delivery of essential services and free resources for our national defense,” he stated. 
He also praised the Afghan security forces for defending their country in the ongoing war.

269,Taliban Takeover Would Make Afghanistan 'Pariah State': Blinken | TOLOnews,"The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday told reporters in India that Afghanistan would become a “pariah state” if the government commits atrocities against its own population.
""An Afghanistan that does not respect the rights of its people, an Afghanistan that commits atrocities against its own people would become a pariah state,"" Blinken said.
He said that the violence carried out by the Taliban against the Afghan people was deeply troubling and not a good sign for the future of the country. 
""Yes, certainly what we were seeing on the ground in the last week is the Taliban making advances on district centers, challenging some provincial capitals,” Blinken said, adding: “We have also seen these reports of atrocities committed by the Taliban in areas that it has taken over; that are deeply, deeply troubling and certainly do not speak well of the Taliban's intentions for the country as a whole."" 
Blinken, who was in New Delhi for talks with Indian leaders, said the only path to peace in Afghanistan was through negotiations, and that all parties must take them seriously. 
""The Taliban says that it seeks international recognition, that it wants international support for Afghanistan. Presumably it wants its leaders to be able to travel freely in the world, sanctions lifted, etc. Well, the taking over the country by force and abusing the rights of its people is not the path to achieve those objectives,” he said. 
“There's only one path and that's at the negotiating table to resolve the conflict peacefully and to have an Afghanistan emerge that is governed in a genuinely inclusive way and that's representative of all its people,” he further said. 
India’s External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also underlined the importance of the peace negotiations in Afghanistan. 
“The gains to Afghan civil society, especially rights of women, minorities and social freedom –over the last two decades are self-evident,” he said, adding that “Afghanistan must never be home to insurgents, nor become a source of refugees.” 
He also said that it is essential that peace negotiations are taken “seriously by all parties.” 
“The world wishes to see an independent, sovereign, and democratic Afghanistan, at peace with itself and its neighbors,” said Jaishankar.

“They destroy the mosques, they destroy schools and the artists,” said Ahmadullah Nawed, the deputy of the Administrative Office of the President.
“First we need to recapture the geography that we lost,” said Fawzia Koofi, a member of the peace negotiating team representing the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in the talks with the Taliban in Doha.

276,Pakistan’s PM Criticizes US for Its Policy Towards Taliban | TOLOnews,"Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan said the United States and its ally NATO should have talked to the Taliban years before when there was a huge number of foreign forces deployed in the country. 
“The Americans should have started talking to the Taliban from a position of strength when there were 150,000 NATO troops in Afghanistan,” Khan said on Friday. “That was the time to talk with them. Talking to them when there is an exist date given, and when there are few thousand troops left, how do they expect the Taliban would now compromise?” 
Khan said that majority of the three million Afghan refugees who are in Pakistan are “sympathizing and supporting the Taliban.” 
“To have a political compromise between the Taliban and the government, to have a compromise, an inclusive government that is the only solution. Now what the Taliban are doing or not doing has nothing to do with us. All we want is that there should be peace in Afghanistan. Pakistan’s interest is in peace there,” Khan said. 
He added: “The three million Afghan refugees in Pakistan, almost all of them are Pashtuns and all of them, almost of them, would have sympathies with the Taliban. How is Pakistan supposed to check who is going over there to fight or not when about 25,000 or 30,000 people who cross every day? They are going to Afghanistan and come back.” 
Meanwhile, Chinese Defense Ministry said that the US is responsible for the current situation in Afghanistan and that it cannot put the burden on the shoulder of others in the region. 
“The United States as a responsible party in Afghanistan has an inevitable responsibility for the current situation in the country. The US can’t put the entire burden on the shoulders of other countries in the region,” Wu Qian, the director of the Information Bureau of Ministry of National Defense of China, said. “The US needs to take its responsibility with seriousness in order to have confidence about the situation there and to prevent the possible war after the withdrawal of US forces.”

Addressing an event at the inauguration of what the Presidential Palace termed ""electronic governance,"" Ghani highlighted the importance of the implementation of his six-month plan and said one part of it includes public mobilization for defending the system under the leadership of the National Directorate of Security.
“A Talib that has changed in the last 24 hours. What is their change? They have become more cruel, more oppressive, more non-Muslim,” Ghani said.
Ghani blamed the Taliban for creating the conditions for the presence of foreign terrorists in Afghanistan and said that based on his plan, the country’s situation will witness a change within the next six months.
“They will not engage in meaningful negotiations unless the situation changes on the battlefield; therefore, we should have a clear stance. For this, there is a need for a countrywide mobilization,” Ghani said.
One of the problems on the battlefield, according to President Ghani, is the delay of payments to security force members. He asked government officials to avoid corruption and don’t make him “ashamed” among Afghanistan’s partners.
He also criticized appointments in government institutions and said some employees in key institutions have been appointed all from one district, calling it against the principles of the Republic.
“There are some provinces in which one district has monopolized all the government seats. The Republic cannot be made with inherited family,” Ghani said.

287,EU Special Envoy Sees ‘No Change’ in Taliban | TOLOnews,"The EU special envoy for Afghanistan Tomas Niklasson said he sees no clear indication of a fundamental change in the Taliban based on considering what they say compared to what they do in the peace process and efforts for a political settlement to end the conflict in the country.
Talking to TOLOnews, Niklasson said that taking power by force will lead to international isolation and the establishment of a so-called Islamic emirate will lead to isolation.
He said that the choice for the Taliban now is either to negotiate, to find a settlement, or decide if they want an isolated Afghanistan, as in the past.
He added that this choice must be made clear.
The EU special envoy said that the Taliban at least formally committed to returning to the negotiating table and said they are not interested in taking Kabul by force, but they should put these two together and return to the talks in a meaningful way.
For the moment, the Taliban largely want to pursue a military campaign, whether that is to take power by force or strengthen their negotiating position.
“I think they are honest and earnest, they want peace, but they may well want peace from a position of strength and they may want peace on their conditions and as long as they still see the possibility which I think isn’t there but as long as they think there is a possibility of taking power by force, or as long as they think that they can still strengthen their negotiating position further by advancing, they will continue to do so,” he said.
He said that Taliban will pay more attention to the final result rather than to the means.
He said that there is “no clear indication” that the Taliban has fundamentally changed.
“I have to base it on what I see and what I hear,” he said in response to a question whether the Taliban has changed. “I hear commitments to change but I must also look at very seriously the behavior we see in districts taken by the Taliban in recent weeks and months where we see repeated, frequent and widespread violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights to which Afghanistan has signed up. We see girls being prevented from going to schools, we see hands being cut off as a former punishment after rudimentary judicial processes if any, we see looting of civilian property, we see destruction of public property.”
“This is something I have to take into account when I try to form my own opinion on whether they have changed,” he said. “I haven’t seen anything put on the table that explains a different outlook on what Afghanistan under Taliban rule would look like on which I could form a different opinion.”
The EU special envoy said that public uprising forces are an understandable phenomenon and he hopes they play a positive role. But he added that it is accompanied by some risks.
He said that Pakistan should make a choice about whether it wants a stable Afghanistan or an isolated Afghanistan that is governed by a regime over which Pakistan believes it has some influence.

289,Taliban ‘Will Be Defeated’ If No Political Settlement: Karzai | TOLOnews,"In an interview with Russian media, former president Hamid Karzai said the Taliban “will be defeated” by Afghans and the people will confront them and will form an uprising against them if the group continues its violence.
“If the Taliban continue to oppose that--this would be confronted but I want this confrontation to be political, not military,” Karzai said in an interview with Russia’s RTA. “They must agree to that or they will be defeated. The Afghan people will rise against them.”
Karzai said the Afghan people are giving the Taliban an opportunity.
“This means an opportunity to coexist and to allow the country to progress. If they don’t allow that and if they continue to seek their own domination of Afghanistan the way they think of it, that will give rise to a national uprising without a doubt and I will be one of those people,” Karzai said.
He added that the current situation is challenging but he hopes that the country will move toward improvement.
When asked about the best- and worst-case scenarios for Afghanistan within the next one or two years, Karzai said he doesn’t see the worst-case scenario for Afghanistan.
“I have the best-case scenario for Afghanistan. I am seeing some trends towards that. Yes, we are, at the moment, in a very, very difficult spot. There’s immense violence in Afghanistan. There’s immense anger in our country, but I also see the Afghans are waking up to the new reality and those who want to want to, opt to stay in Afghanistan, will make it better,” he added.
This comes as US State Department spokesman Ned Price on Monday said that the Taliban is responsible for “outrageous and atrocious acts of violence.”
“Well, there’s one party that is in most cases, responsible for the outrageous and atrocious acts of violence that have been perpetrated against the Afghan people, and that’s the Taliban, of course, other terrorist groups, ISIS also active, but we have seen an increase in these ongoing Taliban attacks. They show little regard for human life, for the rights of the Afghan people, including the basic right of the Afghan people to live in safety and security,” he said.
He added that “the targeted killings, the destruction of buildings and bridges, other vital infrastructure, other violent acts against the people of Afghanistan, we recognize they are in stark contravention to statements from the Taliban leadership.”

292,Atmar Calls For Increased Pressure by Intl Community on Taliban | TOLOnews,"Foreign Minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar on Tuesday said that Qatar will host two key meetings on Afghanistan in the coming days but added that there is a need for more action by the international community beyond merely issuing statements from these events. 
Atmar said that two important meetings will be held in Qatar in the coming days: one with regional and international allies and an Extended Troika session. 
“In these two meetings, the firmness of the region and the international community through political means should be explained to the Taliban so they know that they are not only facing the people and the government of Afghanistan but also they are also facing a united stance of the region and the international community, and they must end violence,” Atmar said at a news conference.
Atmar said that two meetings were hosted by Kabul with representatives of over 20 countries from the region and representatives of 15 other countries and organizations to discuss the challenging security situation in Afghanistan, the political situation, the violation of human rights “by the Taliban” and the Afghan government’s security plan. 
Atmar said that they told the representatives that the Taliban is supported by “foreign terrorists” and that the group is focusing their attacks on cities rather than focusing on peace efforts.  
He said that the Afghan government at the session asked the international community to put pressure on the Taliban to respect human rights and return to meaningful negotiations. 
“Our focus was on the International Criminal Court, the International Human Rights Organization, the council of human rights, and the High Commissioner of the UN for Human Rights,” Atmar said, referring to his meetings with the representatives. 
Atmar added that the Qatar negotiations must succeed as they have the full support of Afghans and the international community.  
He stated that the Qatar negotiations have one hurdle: the Taliban's insistence on totalitarianism and their focus on fighting. 
This comes as heavy fighting has continued in two major cities, Lashkargah and Herat, for the last week, leaving many people displaced and dozens killed in both provinces.

“The Taliban reached the guard towers of the police HQ but the government forces engaged them,” he said.
Several airstrikes have been launched by Afghan and US air forces since Tuesday night, according to security sources.
A market area was damaged during the fighting.
“Both the Afghan forces and the Taliban have suffered casualties but there is no exact information yet,” according to the security sources.
Civilian casualties have also been reported but no exact information is available. Hundreds of families have been displaced.  
On Tuesday, the commander of the Army's 215 Maiwand Corps, Gen. Sami Sadat, urged Lashkargah residents to evacuate their houses as the ANDSF is planning large-scale operations to clear the city of Taliban.  
Gen. Sadat said he made the announcement because the safety of residents is the priority of the ANDSF.
After the announcement, hundreds of commandos lead by Gen. Hibatullah Alizai, the commander of the Special Operations Corps arrived in Lashkargah to launch a clearing operation in the city.
Gen. Sadat and Alizai launched the operation on Tuesday night but said they have made “no major progress yet,” sources said.
However, Fawad Aman, the deputy spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, said: “Fresh troops--including commandos--have been deployed to Lashkargah and a clearing operation has been launched. Because the Taliban hide in residential houses, the troops are moving slowly but carefully.”
“The situation is bad in Lashkargah, the Taliban have captured most areas of the city and only government buildings are under the control of the security forces,” said Nasima Neeyazi, an MP from Helmand.

Taliban fighters have swiftly gained territory across Afghanistan since May, including six provincial capitals in the last three days, as international forces near a complete withdrawal from the country after 20 years of fighting. 
""The capacity-building, the training, the equipment... where is it?"" Qureshi said at a news conference quoted by Reuters. 
Pakistan cannot be held responsible for the failure of others, he further said. 
Kabul and several western governments said Pakistan's support for the Taliban allowed it to weather 20 years of war after being pushed from power in 2001 by a US-led invasion of Afghanistan, the report said. 
The group today controls more territory than that at any point since 2001. 
Pakistan denies supporting the Taliban. Qureshi said Islamabad was not taking sides in Afghanistan. 
""The lack of will to fight, the capitulation that we are seeing in Afghanistan... can we be held responsible for that? No, we cannot,"" Qureshi said, adding that Pakistan supported a political solution to bring peace to Afghanistan. 
Qureshi said Islamabad was concerned at the violence and the lack of progress in peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government, saying that Pakistan had most to lose from an unstable Afghanistan as a direct neighbor. 
A protracted war in Afghanistan is Pakistan's “nightmare scenario,” the country's national security advisor to Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Monday, according to an AP report. 
Moeed Yusuf said Pakistan is pushing the Taliban to return to negotiations, but its leverage is waning as the insurgent group gains more ground in Afghanistan. 
Yusuf also attacked the performance of Afghanistan's National Defense and Security Forces, claiming over a trillion dollars was put into Afghanistan: ""What is going on with this well-equipped and trained force?”
In their sweep through Afghanistan, which began with the late April start of the final withdrawal of US and NATO troops, the Taliban have gained control of strategic and lucrative border crossings, including the Spin Boldak crossing with Pakistan. 
Last weekend the Taliban closed it, after Islamabad demanded that Afghans crossing to the Pakistani side have a passport and a Pakistani visa, something that had not previously been required.

On Wednesday night the Taliban attacked Herat city from four directions but faced a “huge response” from security and public uprising forces, said Abdul Saboor Qani, the provincial governor. 
“At least 30 Taliban were killed and dozens of others were wounded,” Qani said, adding that “one security force member was also killed and four others were wounded.” 
“The air force also supported the local troops in fighting against the Taliban,” he said. 
Also on Wednesday night, Afghan forces pushed back Taliban attacks on Qala-e-Naw, the capital of Badghis province, said provincial governor Hasamuddin Shams. 
“At least 60 Taliban, including their four commanders, were killed in the clashes and 50 others were wounded,” he said. 
“Fighting still continues in some parts of the outskirts of Qala-e-Naw but the government forces have controlled the situation,” he said.

“The condition is that as long as Ashraf Ghani is there, we (the Taliban) are not going to talk to the Afghan government,” Khan said, quoting the Taliban leaders, according to the report. 
Representatives of a number of countries, including the US, are currently in the Qatari capital of Doha talking to both sides in a last-ditch push for a ceasefire. 
Khan said he tried to persuade Taliban leaders when they were visiting Pakistan to reach a settlement. 
A political settlement in Afghanistan was looking difficult under current conditions, Khan added. 
President Imran Khan also said that Washington has been pressing Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban to broker a peace deal as negotiations between the insurgents and Afghan government have stalled, and violence in Afghanistan has escalated sharply, according to Reuters. 
“Pakistan is just considered only to be useful in the context of somehow settling this mess which has been left behind after 20 years of trying to find a military solution when there was not one,” he said. 
The United States will pull out its military by Aug. 31, 20 years after toppling the Taliban government in 2001. But, as the United States leaves, the Taliban today controls more territory than at any point since then. 
Kabul and several Western governments say Pakistan’s support for the insurgent group allowed it to weather the war, said Reuters.  
The charge of supporting the Taliban despite being a US ally has long been a sore point between Washington and Islamabad.  
But Pakistan denies supporting the Taliban. 
“I think that the Americans have decided that India is their strategic partner now, and I think that’s why there’s a different way of treating Pakistan now,” Khan said. 
Pakistan and India are archrivals and have fought three wars. The two share frosty ties and currently have minimal diplomatic relations. 
The Republic's negotiating team in Doha led by Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, called on the international community, especially Troika meeting member states, to adopt serious measures to prevent Taliban attacks on cities, which “have led to war crimes"" and ""widespread human rights abuses,"" the Afghan Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued on Thursday.
Speaking at the ""Extended Troika Meeting"" with China, US, Russia and Pakistan, Abdullah stated that ""the Taliban's bloody attacks in collusion with regional and international terrorists"" will lead to a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" and will incite more terrorism in the region that will threaten the world. 
Abdullah stressed the need to start meaningful negotiations to establish an immediate ceasefire and to reach a political agreement, said the foreign ministry. 
On Thursday, the Afghan government handed a proposal to Taliban negotiators in Qatar offering a power-sharing deal in return for an end to fighting, according to a member of the government's team in Doha who asked not to be named, AFP reported.

“The Taliban gained a legitimacy which shouldn’t have been given to them as a group,” said Wahid Omar, a top aide to President Ashraf Ghani.
“The deal (US-Taliban agreement) increased the reputation of the Taliban,” said Sayed Akbar Agha, a former Taliban commander.
“The prisoners were released, but a ceasefire was not announced, the prisoners were released, but the peace process did not progress a single step,” said political analyst Sayed Eshaq Gailani.
However, a Taliban spokesman said that the US acted against the Doha peace agreement, adding that the current crisis originates from the violation of the Doha agreement by the US and the Afghan government.
“Unfortunately they announced a war on the second day of Eid. On the third day of Eid, they again announced war, then they went to the Parliament and announced a war,” said Mohammad Naeem, a Taliban spokesman.
“The outcomes of the talks are fake, they are fake, they are fake,” said war victim Abdul Latif.
Under the US-Taliban peace deal signed in Doha in February 2020, the US committed to leave the country by May 1, but US President Joe Biden extended the pullout deadline to September 11, 2021, without conditions. 
“It was a surprising decision, but our reaction was that the US as a sovereign country takes its own sovereign decisions and it will have aftershocks,” said Wahid Omar, a top aide to Ghani.
With the announcement of Biden’s withdrawal plan, the US and NATO forces started withdrawing from their bases, including the Bagram airbase. The Taliban increased its attacks at this time.

338,Sweeping Conquests Challenge US Hopes of Better-behaved Taliban | TOLOnews,"Recent Taliban advances in Afghanistan are challenging the Biden administration’s hopes that a desire for international respect, and for international aid and cash, may moderate the group’s worst behaviors when the US ends its war in the South Asian country.
While showing interest in a diplomatic settlement, Taliban commanders have accelerated their battlefield advances ahead of the US military’s withdrawal at the end of August. The group has at least 17 provinces under its control.
Quoted by the Associated Press, rights groups have said that others have acted much like the brutal Taliban the US overthrew in 2001. That includes allegedly killing detainees en masse and demanding that communities provide them with females above age 15 to marry. A Taliban spokesman has denied the allegations.
Still, Biden administration officials have kept up the hopeful claim that a desire for international approval might influence Taliban actions. They reject criticism by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell R-Ky, who opposes the withdrawal and dismisses what he calls “diplomatic carrots,” the Associated Press reports.
“If the Taliban claim to want international legitimacy these actions are not going to get them the legitimacy they seek,’’ White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday as quoted by the Associated Press.
This comes after a meeting on Afghanistan’s peace in Doha last week. US special envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad also traveled to Qatar to make that point to Taliban officials directly. 
“We demand an immediate end to attacks against cities, urge a political settlement, and warn that a government imposed by force will be a pariah state,” Khalilzad said after the meeting.
Regardless of whether the Taliban heeds that warning, President Joe Biden is showing no sign of slowing or reversing a decision to withdraw from the war.
The United States is ending its nearly 20-year combat mission in Afghanistan on Aug. 31 under a deal that President Donald Trump signed with the Taliban in 2020. 
Only three countries – Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – recognized the Taliban regime back in late 1990s.
The United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Friday asked the Taliban to immediately end its offensive and said seizing power through military forces is a losing proposition.
He said that it is particularly horrifying and heartbreaking to see reports of the hard-won rights of Afghan girls and women being ripped away from them.
“I am also deeply disturbed by early indications that the Taliban are imposing severe restrictions on human rights in the areas under their control, particularly targeting women and journalists,” Guterres said.

The Administration should move quickly to hammer Taliban advances with air strikes, provide critical support to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) defending the capital, and prevent the seemingly imminent fall of the city,” McConnell said in a statement.
“If they fail to do so, the security threat to the United States will assuredly grow and the humanitarian cost to innocent Afghans will be catastrophic,” he warned.
McConnell added that he had spoken with the Afghanistan ambassador to the US, saying they had “an urgent conversation” regarding “the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan and the unfolding humanitarian crisis.”

“Just like Logar and Uruzgan, people wanted handover of areas to prevent bloodshed. Government officials evacuated and handed the areas to the Taliban,” said MP Mirza Mohammad Katawazi.
In the north, Taliban Worsak and Sayed Karam districts in Takhar province, according to local officials.
“Previously, we urged the government to reinforce the checkpoints, but the government did not provide equipment on time,” Jawed Safi, an MP from Kunar.
“The Taliban launched offensives on Maidan Wardak. There was huge fighting in the center of the province,” said Sharifullah Hotak, member of Maidan Wardak provincial council.
The government has said that the security forces have inflicted a major toll on the Taliban in the past 24 hours.
“From the begging till today, Afghanistan’s security and political situations have been under the control of the United States. The recent developments in the country are also part of America’s foreign policy,” said Sayed Amin Muqaddam, a political commentator.
But, the Ministry of Defense said the security situation will improve.
“Afghanistan’s security and defense will defend and protect the gains the country made over the past 20 years,” said MoD spokesman Rohullah Ahmadzai.
This comes as President Ghani assigned Gen. Sami Sadat to lead efforts for Kabul security, according to the Presidential Palace.

344,UN Secretary General to Taliban: The World is Watching | TOLOnews,"UN Secretary General António Guterres in a speech to the Security Council on the ongoing situation in Afghanistan said that the international community expects the Taliban to respect international humanitarian law and the fundamental rights of the Afghans, particularly Afghan women and girls. He said there have been ""chilling reports"" of ""severe restrictions on human rights"" and accounts of ""mounting human rights violations"" against women and girls.
He said that the world is following events in Afghanistan with a ""heavy heart and deep disquiet about what lies ahead.""
“All of us have seen the images in real time. Chaos. Unrest. Uncertainty. And fear,” he said.
On the hopes of the new generation of Afghanistan, he said: “Much lies in the balance. The progress. The hope. The dreams of a generation of young Afghan women and girls, boys and men.   
The UN Secretary General urged all parties, especially the Taliban, to exercise ""utmost restraint"" to protect lives and to ensure that humanitarian needs can be met.
“I remind all parties of their obligation to protect civilians. I call on all parties to provide humanitarians with unimpeded access to deliver timely and life-saving services and aid,” said the UN chief.
“And I also urge all countries to be willing to receive Afghan refugees and refrain from any deportations. Now is the time to stand as one,” said the UN chief.
He said he was ""relieved to report"" that in ""large measure"" UN personnel and premises in Afghanistan have ""been respected,"" and urged the Taliban to continue to ""honor the integrity and inviolability of diplomatic envoys and premises.""
Guterres said that the international community must be united and ""speak with one voice to uphold human rights in Afghanistan.""
Speaking of Afghan women and girls, he said: ""They are looking to the international community for support--the same international community that assured them that opportunities would be expanded, education would be guaranteed, freedoms would spread and rights would be secured.""
Guterres said the ""international community must unite to make sure that Afghanistan is never again used as a platform or safe haven for terrorist organizations.""
The United Nations is committed to supporting Afghans, he said, adding that basic services must continue to be provided amid a humanitarian crisis affecting a large portion of the population. 
He noted that in a statement issued on Sunday the Taliban said that they ""would work with existing institutions,"" and the secretary general said it is ""crucial that civil servant salaries continue to be paid, infrastructure is maintained, airports are reopened, and health and education services continue."" 
""The United Nations presence will adapt to the security situation,"" he said, and ""above all, we will stay and deliver in support of the Afghan people in their hour of need.""
He called for an ""immediate end to violence, for the rights of all Afghans to be respected and for Afghanistan to comply with all international agreements to which it is a party.""
Guterres said ""the following days will be pivotal,"" and ""the world is watching.""
